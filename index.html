    <h1>The Cottonwood Collection</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A public reference library on harm, care, and stewardship</p>

    <p>At <a href="https://hplcompany.com/?utm_source=cottonwood&amp;utm_medium=projects&amp;utm_campaign=stewardship">the hpl company</a>, we have developed a system of values that govern our decisions. One principle is <em>stewardship</em>.</p>

    <p>When we first began to explore this idea internally, we identified a critical marketplace gap. Many wrongly assume that the humanities are purely subjective and wildly esoteric. Our conjecture is that this is an artifact of biases in industrial-age academic culture &mdash; a legacy of institutions that valued what could be measured over what could be reasoned about, and in doing so, orphaned twenty-five centuries of practical moral philosophy from the systems that need it most.</p>

    <p>We propose a new solution, inspired by the cottonwood &mdash; in Latin, <span class="latin">Populus</span>, meaning "the people." The cottonwood is a tree found around the world. It grows in disturbed soil. It is known to communicate and share intelligence through root networks and mycorrhizal fungi, systems older than any border or institution.</p>

    <div class="names">
      <p>In English: <strong>cottonwood</strong></p>
      <p>In Mandarin: <strong>&#x6768;&#x6811;</strong> (y&aacute;ng sh&ugrave;)</p>
      <p>In Hindi: <strong>&#x092A;&#x0949;&#x092A;&#x0932;&#x0930;</strong> (poplar)</p>
      <p>In Latin: <strong><span class="latin">Populus</span></strong> &mdash; the people</p>
    </div>

    <p>The goal of this collection is to share our findings as we strive to build a comprehensive map exploring how human civilizations throughout time have reasoned about harm, care, and the protection of those who cannot protect themselves.</p>

    <p>Our goal, as always, is to stay true to first principles &mdash; but we recognize the undertaking is ambitious, spanning more than twenty-five centuries and six continents. It is free to read, free to cite. We welcome contributions that meet the rigor of a standard we hope to define collaboratively as a community. And most importantly, it will always be free to index.</p>

    <p>The reason is simple: the knowledge of humanity that has been collected and is rightly owned by the public should be displayed freely, proudly &mdash; warts and all. For how else can we learn if not from our past?</p>

    <h2>The Collection</h2>

    <p>This library is organized along three axes. <strong>Frameworks</strong> survey how philosophical and religious traditions have reasoned about harm, care, and the moral status of those who cannot advocate for themselves. <strong>Histories</strong> trace what actually happened in a place &mdash; the people, the events, the ideas as they emerged in context. <strong>Knowledge Systems</strong> examine how human civilizations have produced, validated, and transmitted knowledge &mdash; organized along the classical liberal arts: the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). A single concept like justice appears across many histories; a single country&rsquo;s history touches many frameworks; a single knowledge system like rhetoric shaped how both were argued for and preserved. The three axes are meant to be read together.</p>

    <h3>Frameworks</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/western/"><em>Western tradition</em></a> &mdash; Mill, Kant, Rawls, care ethics, the harm principle</li>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/chinese/"><em>Chinese tradition</em></a> &mdash; Confucian r&eacute;n, Mohist universal care, Mencius on innate moral sense</li>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/indian/"><em>Indian tradition</em></a> &mdash; ahimsa, dharma, Buddhist compassion, Ashoka&rsquo;s edicts</li>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/islamic/"><em>Islamic tradition</em></a> &mdash; maslaha, hifz al-nafs, the maqasid al-shariah</li>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/abrahamic/"><em>Abrahamic timeline</em></a> &mdash; Sumerian origins through Mosaic law, prophetic tradition, rabbinic Judaism, early Christianity, medieval branches, the Reformation, and modern movements</li>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/comparative/"><em>Comparative themes</em></a> &mdash; cross-tradition convergences on harm, suppression of knowledge, and duties to the vulnerable</li>
      <li><a href="/frameworks/german/"><em>German-speaking traditions</em></a> &mdash; Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, the Frankfurt School, Marx, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Husserl, Gadamer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Histories</h3>

    <p>Country and regional histories are in development. Rather than flatten distinct civilizations into categorical labels, each history will trace the intellectual and moral traditions of a place on its own terms &mdash; and link to the frameworks those traditions informed.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge Systems</h3>

    <p>The classical liberal arts &mdash; seven disciplines that predate the industrial university and its artificial walls between departments. The trivium governs how we communicate and reason. The quadrivium governs how we measure and model the world. Together, they are the foundation on which every applied discipline rests.</p>

    <p><strong>The Trivium</strong> &mdash; the verbal arts</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/grammar/"><em>Grammar</em></a> &mdash; language, structure, and the encoding of knowledge across cultures</li>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/logic/"><em>Logic</em></a> &mdash; reasoning, proof, and traditions of argumentation from Aristotle to Ny&#x0101;ya</li>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/rhetoric/"><em>Rhetoric</em></a> &mdash; persuasion, discourse, and how arguments move people to action</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Quadrivium</strong> &mdash; the numerical arts</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/arithmetic/"><em>Arithmetic</em></a> &mdash; number systems, quantification, and counting traditions across civilizations</li>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/geometry/"><em>Geometry</em></a> &mdash; spatial reasoning, architecture, surveying, and sacred geometry</li>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/music/"><em>Music</em></a> &mdash; harmony, acoustics, and the mathematical relationships in sound</li>
      <li><a href="/knowledge-systems/astronomy/"><em>Astronomy</em></a> &mdash; celestial observation, calendar systems, and navigation by stars</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Knowledge system pages are in development. As with histories, the goal is depth over breadth &mdash; each discipline traced across the civilizations that practiced it, not confined to the Western canon that named it.</p>

    <h2>Contributing</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/the-hpl-company/cottonwood">source repository</a> is public. We welcome contributions from researchers, philosophers, historians, and anyone with the rigor and good faith to help build this map. The governance is the git log &mdash; every contribution visible, every change auditable.</p>

    <h2>On Openness</h2>

    <p>This site serves a <a href="/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> that welcomes every crawler without restriction. This is deliberate. Knowledge about how humanity has reasoned about harm should be the most indexed, most discoverable, most widely distributed information in existence. Restricting access to ethical reasoning defeats its purpose.</p>

    <div class="principle">
      <p>The cottonwood grows in disturbed soil. It communicates through networks it did not build and does not own. When one tree is under stress, the network carries the signal. This is the model we follow.</p>

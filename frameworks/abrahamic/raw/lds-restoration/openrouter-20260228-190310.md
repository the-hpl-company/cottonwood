### **The Latter-day Saint (LDS) Ethical Tradition: A Distinct Abrahamic Branch**  

The Latter-day Saint tradition (LDS/Mormonism) presents itself as a *restoration*—not reformation—of the original Abrahamic covenant (D&C 132:31), with ethical implications that distinguish it from other Abrahamic branches. Its ethical framework emerges from scripture (Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price), prophetic teachings, and lived communal experience.

### **1. The Book of Mormon as Ethical Text**  
#### **King Benjamin’s Address: Service as Divine Worship (Mosiah 2-5)**  
- **Mosiah 2:17**: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."  
  - Ethical obligation is not abstract but concrete: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked (Mosiah 4:26).  
  - **Warning against inequality**: "Ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain" (Mosiah 4:16-24).  
  - **Contrast with Protestant individualism**: Care for the poor is a communal, covenantal duty.  

#### **The Anti-Nephi-Lehies: Pacifism as Covenant (Alma 24)**  
- A people who bury weapons and choose death over violence (Alma 24:17-19).  
- **Ethical contrast with just war theory**: No exceptions for "righteous war"; violence is a last resort (Alma 43:45-47).  
- **Scholarly tension**: Later Nephite wars (Alma 48:14) complicate this pacifist ideal—suggesting an unresolved ethical tension.

### **2. Doctrine & Covenants 121: The Ethics of Power**  
- **D&C 121:41-44**: "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness."  
  - **Critique of authoritarianism**: Power must be exercised with "love unfeigned" (v. 41).  
  - **Abuse of authority leads to loss of divine sanction (v. 37)**—a radical check on religious hierarchy.  
  - **Comparison to Catholic clericalism**: Unlike Catholic ecclesiology, LDS authority is conditional on ethical conduct.  

---

### **3. The Law of Consecration: Economic Equality as Covenant (D&C 42, 82, 104)**  
- **D&C 42:30-33**: "All things common" (cf. Acts 2:44-45).  
- **United Order experiments (1830s-1890s)**: Voluntary communal economics, later adapted to tithing/welfare.  
- **Comparison with Anabaptists**: Similar to Hutterite communes but with stronger prophetic oversight.  
- **Modern application**: The LDS welfare program (1936-present) institutionalizes care without state dependency.

### **4. Joseph Smith’s Ethical Innovations**  
#### **King Follett Discourse (1844) – Human Potential for Divinization**  
- "You have got to learn how to be gods yourselves" (*Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, 346).  
  - **Ethical implication**: Moral progress is eternal; humans are co-creators with God.  
  - **Comparison with Orthodox theosis**: Similar but more materialist—exaltation includes physical resurrection.  

#### **"Correct Principles" as Ethical Method**  
- "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves" (*Millennial Star*, 1851).  
  - Contrasts with legalistic approaches (e.g., Talmudic halakha, Islamic fiqh).  

#### **Articles of Faith (1842) – Ethical Summary**  
- **13th Article**: "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men."  

---

### **5. Pioneer Experience as Ethical Formation**  
- **Trek West (1846-47)**: Communal suffering forged solidarity.  
- **Temple-building (Nauvoo, Salt Lake)**: Volunteer labor as consecration.  
- **"Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without"**: Austerity as virtue.  
- **Seagulls and crickets (1848)**: Effort precedes providence—a rejection of passive grace.  

---

### **6. Modern Prophetic Tradition**  
- **General Conference**: Ongoing ethical instruction (e.g., "Lift Where You Stand," Uchtdorf, 2008).  
- **Welfare Program (1936-present)**: Institutionalized care (cf. Catholic social teaching).  
- **Proclamation on the Family (1995)**:  
  - **Tensions**: Gender roles are fixed ("fathers preside"), conflicting with modern egalitarianism.  

---

### **7. Tensions and Challenges**  
- **Polygamy (1843-1890)**: Ethical contradictions between D&C 132 (plural marriage) and Jacob 2:24 (monogamy as standard).  
- **Priesthood restriction (pre-1978)**: Racial exclusion reversed in *Official Declaration 2*—raises questions about prophetic fallibility.  
- **Prophetic authority vs. individual conscience**: Cases like the 2015 LGBTQ policy (later modified) show tension between revelation and cultural change.  

---

### **8. Continuing Revelation vs. Other Abrahamic Models**  
- **Rabbinic interpretation (Talmud)**: Fixed text, evolving hermeneutics.  
- **Islamic ijtihad**: Limited to qualified scholars.  
- **LDS model**: Prophets receive new revelation (D&C 1:38), making ethics dynamic.  

---

### **9. Key Scholars**  
- **Terryl Givens** (*Wrestling the Angel*) – LDS theology as distinct from Protestantism.  
- **Richard Bushman** (*Rough Stone Rolling*) – Joseph Smith’s ethical complexity.  
- **Patrick Mason** (*Restoration*) – LDS ethics in global context.  
- **Adam Miller** (*Letters to a Young Mormon*) – Existential ethics.

### **Conclusion: A Living Ethical Tradition**  
The LDS ethical framework is **covenantal, communal, and dynamic**, rooted in service, economic justice, and prophetic authority—but with unresolved tensions. Unlike Protestant sola scriptura or Catholic magisterium, it claims **ongoing divine guidance**, making its ethics a work in progress.  

**Citations:**  
- *Book of Mormon* (Mosiah 2:17, Alma 24)  
- *Doctrine & Covenants* (D&C 121:41, 42:30)  
- *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith* (King Follett Discourse)  
- *Official Declaration 2* (1978 priesthood revelation)  

This analysis presents the tradition **on its own terms**, acknowledging both its ethical strengths and its historical struggles.

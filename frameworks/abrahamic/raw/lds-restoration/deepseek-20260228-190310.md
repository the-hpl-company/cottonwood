# The Latter-day Saint Ethical Tradition: A Distinct Abrahamic Branch

## 1. Foundational Claim: Restoration as Ethical Architecture
The LDS tradition asserts **direct prophetic restoration** of the original Abrahamic covenant through Joseph Smith’s First Vision (1820) and subsequent revelations, positioning itself not as Protestant reform but as **reconstitution of primordial truth** (Joseph Smith—History 1:17-20). This shapes its ethical framework as **revelatory, communal, and teleological**—oriented toward human divinization.

## 2. The Book of Mormon as Ethical Text
### King Benjamin’s Address: The Ethics of Service and Equality
- **Mosiah 2:17**: “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.” This grounds ethics in **concrete acts of care**, not abstract piety.
- **Mosiah 4:16-26**: Explicit warning against inequality: “Ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain… For behold, are we not all beggars?” This creates a **covenantal obligation to eliminate poverty**.
- **Mosiah 29**: Republican government as ethical system—**authority by consent**, judges accountable to law.

### The Anti-Nephi-Lehies: Pacifist Challenge
- **Alma 24:17-19**: A people who “bury their weapons of war” and choose death over violating their covenant of peace. This presents **absolute pacifism** as a viable covenant path, contrasting sharply with Augustinian just war theory. Scholar **Patrick Mason** (*The Mormon Menace*) notes this creates an **internal tension** with later LDS narratives of defensive violence.

## 3. Doctrine & Covenants: Ethics of Power and Community
### D&C 121: The Ethics of Authority
- **Verses 34-46**: Perhaps the most sophisticated treatment of power in Abrahamic literature. **Verse 41**: “No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness.” Authority is **conditional upon ethical exercise**.
- **Verse 37**: Warning that “the heavens withdraw themselves” when priesthood is used for “cover[ing] sins, or to gratify pride, or vain ambition.” This establishes **divine withdrawal** as consequence of abuse.

### The Law of Consecration: Economic Equality as Covenant
- **D&C 42:30-39**: “All things… shall be consecrated unto the welfare of the church… every man according to his family.” Establishes **stewardship model**—private management of communal property.
- **D&C 82:17-19**: “Every man [should] seek the interest of his neighbor.” The **United Order experiments** (1830s Ohio/Missouri, 1870s Utah) attempted this, though scholar **Leonard Arrington** (*Great Basin Kingdom*) documents their ultimate failure due to human nature and external pressure.
- **D&C 104:13-18**: Distinction between “solemn covenant” (consecration) and “lesser law” (tithing)—acknowledging **ethical progression** based on community capacity.

## 4. Joseph Smith’s Ethical Innovations
### King Follett Discourse (1844)
- “God himself was once as we are now… you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves.” This **divinization theology** (compare Orthodox *theosis*) elevates ethical action to **cosmic significance**—every moral choice participates in eternal progression.
- **Ethical methodology**: “I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves.” This rejects legalism for **principled agency**, creating tension with later institutional control.

### Articles of Faith (1842)
- **Article 13**: “We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men.” This **virtue ethics** summary emphasizes character formation over rule compliance.

## 5. Pioneer Experience as Ethical Formation
- **The Trek West (1846-47)**: Forced exodus created **ethics of mutual dependence**—the Willie and Martin handcart company disasters became moral exemplars of sacrifice.
- **Temple Building**: Nauvoo (1841-46) and Salt Lake (1853-93) temples built by **volunteer consecration**—labor as worship.
- **Proverbs of Practice**: “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without” reflects **stewardship ethics** born of scarcity.
- **Miracle of the Gulls (1848)**: Often cited as **providence following effort**—ethical lesson that divine help complements, not replaces, human labor.

## 6. Modern Prophetic Tradition
### Institutionalized Care: The Welfare Program
- Established 1936 under President Heber J. Grant during Depression. **Bishops’ storehouses**, **Deseret Industries**—creates **systematic charity** while emphasizing self-reliance. Scholar **Garth Mangum** (*The Mormons’ War on Poverty*) documents its unique blend of local autonomy and central coordination.

### Proclamation on the Family (1995)
- Declares “marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.” Creates **ethical tension** with evolving societal norms. **Terryl Givens** (*The Crucible of Doubt*) notes it functions as both **ethical boundary marker** and source of internal conflict for LGBTQ+ members.

### “Lift Where You Stand” (President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, 2008)
- Ethical methodology: **Local responsibility**—“The Lord… expects you to have enough faith… to lift where you stand.” Rejects passivity for **contextual action**.

## 7. Tensions and Ethical Challenges
### Polygamy (1843-1890)
- **D&C 132**: Establishes “plural marriage” as Abrahamic restoration. Created **profound ethical conflicts**—Emma Smith’s opposition (v. 54), public deception (denial until 1852). **Laurel Thatcher Ulrich** (*A House Full of Females*) documents complex female agency within constraint.
- **1890 Manifesto**: President Wilford Woodruff’s revelation ending practice shows **revelatory ethics can reverse itself**.

### Priesthood Restriction (1844-1978)
- Black men denied priesthood and temple ordinances. **Official Declaration 2** (1978) reversed this without repudiating past practice, creating **ongoing ethical reckoning**. Scholar **W. Paul Reeve** (*Religion of a Different Color*) traces its racialized origins.

### Prophetic Authority vs. Individual Conscience
- **D&C 68:4**: “Whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost… shall be scripture.” This elevates prophetic speech but creates **ethical dilemma** when members dissent. The **September Six** excommunications (1993) exemplify this tension.

## 8. Continuing Revelation as Ethical Framework
- **D&C 1:38**: “Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” Ethics evolve through **living prophets** in General Conference.
- **Comparison**:
  - **Rabbinic interpretation**: Halakhic development through debate (Talmud Bavli Sanhedrin) vs. LDS **presidential revelation**.
  - **Islamic ijtihad**: Independent reasoning by qualified scholars vs. LDS **centralized prophetic authority**.
- **Adam Miller** (*Original Grace*) argues LDS revelation is **event-based** rather than text-based—ethics emerge from divine-human encounter.

## 9. Distinctive Ethical Architecture
The LDS tradition presents a **unique synthesis** within the Abrahamic lineage:

1. **Covenantal communalism** over individualism
2. **Teleological ethics** oriented toward theosis
3. **Revelatory pragmatism**—ethics adapt to “circumstances and conditions” (D&C 124:49)
4. **Agency as paramount virtue**—the “plan of agency” in premortal life (Abraham 3:25-26)

As **Richard Bushman** (*Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling*) observes, the tradition holds in tension its **restorationist claim** with its **radical innovation**—creating an ethical system both ancient and perpetually new.

The Hebrew prophetic tradition constitutes a sustained ethical critique of the Mosaic covenant, interrogating its implementation and calling for justice, mercy, and fidelity to YHWH. Below is an analysis of key prophetic voices and their ethical challenges to the system, with attention to internal tensions and transformative moments.

### 1. **Amos: Justice Over Ritual**
Amos, the earliest writing prophet (mid-8th century BCE), delivers a scathing critique of Israel’s social and religious failures. In **Amos 5:21-23**, he rejects empty ritual: "I hate, I despise your festivals...Take away from me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the melody of your harps." Instead, he demands justice: "Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream" (**5:24**). Amos focuses on the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy (**2:6-7**, **5:11**), highlighting the ethical failure of Israel’s elite. His prophecy marks the first systematic critique of Israel’s institutional religion, prioritizing social justice over cultic observance.

### 2. **Hosea: Covenant Faithfulness**
Hosea develops the metaphor of marriage to describe Israel’s relationship with YHWH, emphasizing *hesed* (loving-kindness/covenant loyalty) as central to ethics. Israel’s unfaithfulness (**Hosea 2:5-13**) is contrasted with YHWH’s enduring love (**2:14-23**). Hosea critiques Israel’s idolatry (**4:12-13**) and calls for repentance (**14:1-3**). His emphasis on relational fidelity reshapes covenantal ethics, moving beyond legalism to a focus on relational integrity.

### 3. **Isaiah: Layers of Ethical Vision**
The Book of Isaiah spans multiple historical contexts and ethical concerns:
- **First Isaiah (1-39)**: Condemns social injustice (**Isaiah 1:17**: "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause") and critiques reliance on political alliances (**31:1**) rather than YHWH.
- **Second Isaiah (40-55)**: Develops universalist ethics during the Babylonian exile, presenting Israel as a "light to the nations" (**42:6**) and introducing the Suffering Servant (**52:13-53:12**). Interpretations diverge: Judaism sees the Servant as Israel itself (e.g., **Isaiah 41:8-9**), Christianity as Jesus (e.g., Acts **8:32-35**), and Islam as a prophetic figure akin to Muhammad (Quran **Surah 3:39**).
- **Third Isaiah (56-66)**: Expands inclusion to foreigners (**56:3-8**) and critiques renewed corruption (**58:1-7**).

### 4. **Jeremiah: The New Covenant**
Jeremiah envisions a transformative ethical shift: "I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts" (**Jeremiah 31:33**). This new covenant emphasizes internalized ethics over external legalism. Jeremiah critiques the temple’s false security (**7:4-11**) and calls for genuine repentance (**4:1-4**). His vision influences later traditions: Christianity sees it fulfilled in Christ (e.g., **Hebrews 8:8-12**), LDS theology in restoration (**Doctrine and Covenants 76:69**), and Judaism in ethical internalism (e.g., Maimonides’ *Mishneh Torah*).

### 5. **Micah: Ethical Essentials**
Micah distills ethical requirements to their essence: "He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?" (**Micah 6:8**). This verse encapsulates the prophetic ethos, balancing justice, mercy, and humility.

### 6. **Ezekiel: Individual Responsibility**
Ezekiel challenges collective guilt models, asserting: "The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father" (**Ezekiel 18:20**). This focus on individual responsibility reshapes Mosaic ethics, emphasizing personal accountability over inherited sin.

---

### 7. **Prophetic vs. Priestly Ethics**
The prophets consistently critique institutional religion:
- Amos rejects ritual without justice (**Amos 5:21-24**).
- Isaiah condemns temple hypocrisy (**Isaiah 1:10-17**).
- Jeremiah declares the temple a "den of robbers" (**Jeremiah 7:11**).  
This tension foreshadows later figures like Jesus (e.g., **Matthew 21:13**), Muhammad (e.g., Quran **Surah 9:107-110**), and Joseph Smith (e.g., *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, pp. 180-181), who all challenge corrupt religious institutions.

### 8. **The Exile as Ethical Crisis**
The Babylonian exile (587 BCE) forces a reevaluation of Israel’s identity and ethics:
- Second Isaiah universalizes Israel’s mission (**Isaiah 42:6-7**).
- Ezekiel emphasizes hope and restoration (**Ezekiel 36:24-28**).
The exile reshapes Israelite ethics, moving from national particularism to a more inclusive vision.

### 9. **Key Scholars**
- **Abraham Joshua Heschel** (*The Prophets*): Emphasizes the prophets’ "divine pathos," portraying them as conveyors of YHWH’s ethical outrage.
- **Walter Brueggemann** (*The Prophetic Imagination*): Analyzes the prophets as disruptors of oppressive systems and catalysts for hope.
- **Joseph Blenkinsopp** (*A History of Prophecy in Israel*): Traces the development of prophetic traditions and their ethical critiques.

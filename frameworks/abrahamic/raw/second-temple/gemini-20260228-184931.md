The Second Temple period (c. 516 BCE – 70 CE) marks a crucial era of ethical formation, innovation, and divergence in the Abrahamic tradition. The destruction of the First Temple in 586 BCE and the subsequent Babylonian exile forced a re-evaluation of Israel's covenant with God. This period witnessed the rise of distinct Jewish sects, the development of wisdom and apocalyptic literature, Hellenistic influences, and ultimately, the emergence of Christianity, all before the devastating destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, which further catalyzed ethical reformulation.

**1. Jewish Sects and Covenantal Ethics:**

The Second Temple period saw the emergence of various Jewish groups, each with distinct interpretations of the Torah and its ethical implications.

*   **Pharisees:** Focused on the oral Torah alongside the written Torah, emphasizing ritual purity, Sabbath observance, and tithing. Their ethical outlook stressed personal piety and social responsibility. They believed in the resurrection of the dead and the coming of a messianic age, which influenced their ethical considerations. Key texts outlining their views are found in the Mishnah and Talmud (e.g., *Mishnah Berakhot* for daily prayers, *Mishnah Peah* for social welfare). As scholar E.P. Sanders argues in *Jesus and Judaism*, the Pharisees sought to make holiness accessible to all Jews, not just the priests.

*   **Sadducees:** Primarily associated with the priestly aristocracy, they rejected the oral Torah and adhered strictly to the written Torah. They did not believe in the resurrection or an afterlife, leading to a more this-worldly ethical focus centered on Temple rituals and maintaining social order. Josephus (*Antiquities of the Jews* 13.10.6) highlights their emphasis on individual free will and rejection of fate. Their ethical framework was intertwined with the Temple's sacrificial system, making them particularly vulnerable after its destruction.

*   **Essenes:** A separatist group, best known through the Dead Sea Scrolls. They emphasized communal living, ritual purity, and strict adherence to their interpretation of the law. Their ethical framework was dualistic, viewing the world as a battle between the "sons of light" and the "sons of darkness" (1QS, *Community Rule*). This influenced their ethical behavior, emphasizing righteousness, humility, and separation from the corrupt world. The *Damascus Document* (CD) further outlines their strict regulations and ethical requirements.

*   **Zealots:** A radical nationalist group who advocated armed rebellion against Roman rule. Their ethical framework prioritized national liberation and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth. Josephus (*The Jewish War*) portrays them as ruthless and uncompromising in their pursuit of independence. Their actions, driven by eschatological hopes and resentment of Roman oppression, led to the devastating Jewish War (66-73 CE).

**2. Wisdom Literature: Law vs. Wisdom:**

Second Temple period wisdom literature grapples with ethical questions beyond the strictures of law.

*   **Proverbs:** Emphasizes practical wisdom for daily living, focusing on virtues like honesty, diligence, and prudence. It operates on a reward-and-punishment system: righteous behavior leads to prosperity, while wickedness leads to ruin (e.g., Proverbs 10:2-3).

*   **Ecclesiastes (Qoheleth):** Offers a skeptical perspective on the meaning of life, questioning the value of human endeavor in the face of death. Qoheleth suggests that all is "vanity" (*hevel*) and that one should enjoy life's simple pleasures while acknowledging the limitations of human understanding (Ecclesiastes 1:2, 3:12-13). This challenges the straightforward covenantal ethic of obedience and reward.

*   **Job:** This book presents the ultimate challenge to covenantal ethics. Job, a righteous man, suffers immensely despite his blamelessness. The book explores the problem of theodicy, questioning God's justice and the simplistic equation of righteousness with prosperity. Despite arguments from his friends that he must have sinned, Job maintains his innocence and demands an explanation from God. God's response, a display of divine power and wisdom, does not provide a clear answer to Job's suffering but emphasizes the limits of human understanding (Job 38-41). As scholar Carol Newsom has argued, Job's story can be read as an exploration of the complexities of justice and the limitations of human attempts to comprehend divine will.

*   **Sirach (Ben Sira):** Written in Hebrew during the early Second Temple period, Sirach seeks to integrate traditional wisdom with Jewish law and theology. It emphasizes the importance of observing the commandments, honoring parents, and maintaining social order (Sirach 3, 7). Unlike Ecclesiastes, Sirach reaffirms the value of wisdom and righteousness, linking them to God's covenant with Israel.

*   **Wisdom of Solomon:** Written in Greek, probably in Alexandria, this book blends Jewish wisdom traditions with Greek philosophical concepts. It emphasizes the immortality of the soul and the ultimate triumph of the righteous (Wisdom 3:1-9). The book presents wisdom as a divine attribute, accessible to those who seek it with sincerity. This text represents a significant step in the Hellenistic synthesis of Jewish and Greek thought.

**3. Apocalyptic Literature: Eschatological Ethics:**

Apocalyptic literature introduces a new dimension to ethical considerations: the expectation of an imminent end-times judgment.

*   **Daniel:** Written during the Maccabean crisis, Daniel depicts a series of visions foretelling the rise and fall of empires and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom. The book encourages faithfulness and perseverance in the face of persecution, promising rewards for those who remain steadfast (Daniel 12:1-3). This eschatological hope motivates ethical behavior, as individuals are judged based on their loyalty to God during a time of crisis.

*   **1 Enoch:** A collection of writings from the Second Temple period, 1 Enoch expands on the themes of judgment, resurrection, and the coming of the Messiah. It presents a detailed cosmology and demonology, emphasizing the struggle between good and evil. The book warns against the wickedness of the present age and urges readers to live righteously in anticipation of the final judgment.

*   **4 Ezra (2 Esdras):** Written after the destruction of the Second Temple, 4 Ezra reflects on the tragedy of the Temple's destruction and the suffering of the Jewish people. The book explores themes of divine justice, human sinfulness, and the hope for future redemption. It describes a series of visions and dialogues between Ezra and an angel, grappling with the problem of evil and the apparent delay of God's promises.

**4. Hellenistic Influence: The Septuagint and Philo:**

The encounter between Judaism and Hellenistic culture profoundly impacted Jewish ethics.

*   **The Septuagint (LXX):** The Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, was a monumental cultural transformation. It introduced Greek philosophical concepts and ethical vocabulary into Jewish thought. Terms like *agape* (love), *logos* (word/reason), and *sophia* (wisdom) took on new meanings within the context of Jewish scripture. This translation facilitated the spread of Jewish ideas among Greek-speaking populations and laid the groundwork for early Christian theology.

*   **Philo of Alexandria:** A Jewish philosopher who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, during the first century CE, Philo sought to synthesize Jewish scripture with Greek philosophy, particularly Platonism. He interpreted the Torah allegorically, finding philosophical truths hidden within the biblical narratives. Philo emphasized the importance of reason and virtue, arguing that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve union with God through contemplation and ethical living.

**5. The Dead Sea Scrolls: Essene Ethics of Separatism:**

The Dead Sea Scrolls offer insights into the ethical framework of the Essenes, a group known for their strict adherence to their interpretation of Jewish law and their separatist lifestyle.

*   **Community Rule (1QS):** This document outlines the rules and regulations for the Essene community. It emphasizes communal living, ritual purity, and strict adherence to the law. The text reveals a dualistic worldview, dividing humanity into the "sons of light" and the "sons of darkness." This division shapes the Essenes' ethical outlook, emphasizing righteousness, humility, and separation from the corrupt world.

*   **War Scroll (1QM):** Describes a future war between the "sons of light" and the "sons of darkness," led by the archangels Michael and Belial. This scroll reveals the Essenes' apocalyptic worldview and their belief in an ultimate triumph of good over evil. The war is depicted as a cosmic struggle, with detailed instructions for military strategy and religious rituals.

*   **Temple Scroll (11QT):** This scroll presents a utopian vision of a rebuilt Temple and a purified society. It outlines detailed regulations for Temple worship, sacrifices, and social life, reflecting the Essenes' desire to create a perfect community based on their interpretation of Jewish law.

**6. The Historical Jesus as Ethical Teacher:**

The teachings of Jesus, particularly as presented in the Gospels, offer a distinctive ethical vision within the Second Temple context.

*   **Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) / Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6):** These sermons present Jesus' ethical manifesto, emphasizing love, compassion, and forgiveness. Key innovations include the call to love one's enemies (Matthew 5:44), non-retaliation (Matthew 5:39), and the Golden Rule in its positive formulation ("Do to others what you would have them do to you," Matthew 7:12). While some of these teachings have parallels in Jewish tradition, Jesus' emphasis on radical love and forgiveness represents a significant development. As scholar Amy-Jill Levine has argued, many of Jesus' teachings were rooted in existing Jewish traditions but were often presented in a more radical or challenging way. For example, Hillel the Elder's formulation of the Golden Rule was negative ("What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor"), while Jesus' version is positive and proactive.

**7. Paul's Universalization: Breaking the Ethnic Boundary:**

The Apostle Paul's teachings represent a radical departure from traditional Jewish ethics, particularly in his emphasis on the universality of salvation.

*   **Galatians 3:28:** "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." This verse encapsulates Paul's vision of a new community that transcends ethnic, social, and gender boundaries. This universalism has profound ethical implications, as it removes the ethnic boundary of the covenant, opening salvation to all who believe in Jesus.

*   **Romans 13 vs. Revelation 13:** Paul's teachings on political authority are complex and sometimes contradictory. In Romans 13, he urges Christians to submit to governing authorities, arguing that they are established by God. However, the Book of Revelation, traditionally attributed to the Apostle John, presents a more critical view of the state, portraying it as a beast that opposes God (Revelation 13). This tension between submission and resistance has been a recurring theme in Christian political ethics throughout history.

**8. The Destruction of the Temple (70 CE) as Ethical Watershed:**

The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE was a cataclysmic event that profoundly impacted Jewish and Christian ethics. Without the Temple, the entire sacrificial/priestly ethical system collapsed, forcing both traditions to re-evaluate their fundamental principles.

*   **Rabbinic Judaism:** Emerged as a response to the Temple's destruction, emphasizing Torah study, prayer, and acts of loving-kindness as substitutes for Temple worship. The Rabbis sought to preserve and transmit the Jewish tradition through legal interpretation, ethical teachings, and the development of the Talmud.

*   **Christianity:** Interpreted the Temple's destruction as a sign of the end times and the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies. Christians saw Jesus as the new Temple, the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. The destruction of the Temple further solidified the separation between Judaism and Christianity.

**Conclusion:**

The Second Temple period was a time of intense ethical ferment, characterized by diverse interpretations of the Torah, the influence of Hellenistic culture, and the emergence of new religious movements. The destruction of the Temple in 70 CE marked a watershed moment, leading to the development of Rabbinic Judaism and the further divergence of Christianity from its Jewish roots. This period continues to shape ethical debates within the Abrahamic traditions to this day.

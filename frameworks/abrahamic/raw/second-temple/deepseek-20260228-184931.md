# The Second Temple Period: The Great Fork in the Abrahamic Tradition

## 1. Jewish Sects: Competing Ethical Readings of the Covenant

The major sects represent distinct ethical-political programs grounded in divergent interpretations of Torah and covenant obligations.

**Pharisees** (*Perushim*, "Separated Ones"):  
- **Primary Sources**: Descriptions in Josephus (*Jewish War* 2.119-166; *Antiquities* 13.171-173, 18.12-15), New Testament (Matthew 23, Luke 11:37-44), later rabbinic traditions tracing to them.  
- **Ethical Framework**: Covenant as conditional on both Temple ritual **and** personal piety through oral Torah interpretation. Emphasized *halakha* (walking) in daily life, resurrection of the dead, and divine judgment. Their ethics were democratized—accessible to all through study and practice, not just priests. The "fence around the Torah" (Mishnah *Avot* 1:1) created preventative ethics.

**Sadducees** (*Tzadokim*, from Zadokite priesthood):  
- **Primary Sources**: Josephus (*Jewish War* 2.164-166; *Antiquities* 13.173), Acts 23:8 (denial of resurrection).  
- **Ethical Framework**: Covenant centered on **Temple cult** and written Torah alone. Rejected oral Torah and resurrection (Mark 12:18). Ethics were aristocratic and ritual-centered—proper Temple service maintained cosmic order. Their disappearance after 70 CE demonstrates the vulnerability of a Temple-dependent ethics.

**Essenes**:  
- **Primary Sources**: Dead Sea Scrolls (especially Community Rule, Damascus Document), descriptions in Josephus (*Jewish War* 2.119-161), Philo (*Every Good Man Is Free* 75-91).  
- **Ethical Framework**: Radical covenant renewal through **separatism**. The *yahad* (community) saw itself as the true Israel living in "the last days" (1QS 1:1, 8:12-16). Ethics were communitarian and dualistic—strict purity codes, shared property, and absolute obedience to the "Teacher of Righteousness" (CD 1:11). Covenant obligations became conditions for membership in the elect remnant.

**Zealots** (*Sicarii*):  
- **Primary Sources**: Josephus (*Jewish War* 7.253-258), coins from First Jewish Revolt.  
- **Ethical Framework**: Covenant as **political liberation**. The "Fourth Philosophy" (Josephus, *Antiquities* 18.23) viewed foreign rule as violation of divine sovereignty. Their ethic was revolutionary—violence as religious duty to restore God's kingdom. This represents a militant reading of Exodus themes.

**Key Scholar**: **E.P. Sanders** (*Judaism: Practice and Belief, 63 BCE–66 CE*) argues these groups shared common "covenantal nomism" but disagreed on **how** to fulfill covenant obligations.

## 2. Wisdom Literature: Ethics Beyond the Covenant

Wisdom literature introduces a universal ethical framework that sometimes challenges retributive covenant theology.

**Proverbs**: Practical, this-worldly ethics. Righteousness brings prosperity (Proverbs 3:9-10, 11:25). The covenant is implicit but not central.

**Ecclesiastes (Qoheleth)**: Radical challenge to conventional wisdom ethics. "Vanity of vanities" (Ecclesiastes 1:2) undermines simple retribution. The righteous suffer, the wicked prosper (7:15, 8:14). Ethics become pragmatic: "Fear God and keep his commandments" (12:13) despite observable injustice.

**Job**: The ultimate theodicy crisis. The prologue (Job 1-2) establishes Job's blamelessness, making his suffering inexplicable within covenant theology. God's answer from the whirlwind (Job 38-41) offers **no** ethical resolution—only divine mystery. This represents a profound rupture in retributive ethics.

**Sirach (Ben Sira)**: Attempts to reconcile wisdom with Torah. "All wisdom is the fear of the Lord" (Sirach 1:14). The ethical innovation: identifies Wisdom with the Torah (24:23). Written c. 180 BCE, it reflects early Second Temple synthesis.

**Wisdom of Solomon**: Hellenistic Jewish ethics. Introduces Platonic immortality of the soul (Wisdom 3:1-4) and Stoic concepts. The righteous may suffer now but receive eternal reward—a solution to the Job problem through eschatology.

## 3. Apocalyptic Literature: Eschatological Ethics

Apocalypticism introduces **temporal dualism**—this evil age versus the coming righteous age—transforming ethical motivation.

**Daniel** (especially chapters 7-12):  
- **Ethical Innovation**: Suffering of the righteous (the *maskilim*, "wise teachers" in 11:33-35) has cosmic significance in an eschatological timetable. Endurance itself becomes ethical act. "Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined" (12:10). Ethics become preparation for resurrection (12:2-3).

**1 Enoch** (especially the Book of Parables, 37-71):  
- Introduces the "Son of Man" figure as eschatological judge. Ethical behavior is motivated by impending judgment. The Watchers myth (1 Enoch 6-16) explains evil's origin, providing cosmic context for ethical struggle.

**4 Ezra** (2 Esdras):  
- Post-70 CE text grappling with Temple destruction. The dialogue between Ezra and Uriel (4 Ezra 3-10) questions divine justice. The resolution is purely eschatological: "The Most High has made not one world but two" (7:50). Ethics become about securing place in the coming age.

**Key Scholar**: **Gabriele Boccaccini** (*Beyond the Essene Hypothesis*) traces apocalyptic thought as a distinct stream within Second Temple Judaism.

## 4. Hellenistic Influence: Greek Ethical Vocabulary

**Philo of Alexandria** (c. 20 BCE–50 CE):  
- **Method**: Allegorical reading of Torah through Platonic/Stoic lenses. Abraham's journey becomes the soul's ascent (*On the Migration of Abraham*). The Logos becomes mediating principle between God and world (*On the Creation* 24-25).  
- **Ethical Transformation**: Greek virtues (prudence, courage, temperance, justice) become expressions of Torah. Philo's *On the Decalogue* presents commandments as universal natural law.

**The Septuagint (LXX)**:  
- **Critical Examples**:  
  - *Torah* becomes *nomos* (law), importing Greek political connotations.  
  - *Hesed* (covenantal loyalty) becomes *eleos* (pity/mercy), shifting from mutual obligation to unilateral compassion.  
  - *Kapparah* (atonement) becomes *hilasmos* (propitiation), emphasizing emotional appeasement.  
- The translation of Isaiah 7:14: *almah* (young woman) becomes *parthenos* (virgin), with profound Christological implications.

## 5. Dead Sea Scrolls: Essene Ethics as Radical Separatism

**Community Rule (1QS)**:  
- **Dualistic Ethics**: "He has created man to govern the world, and has appointed for him two spirits in which to walk until the time of His visitation: the spirits of truth and falsehood" (1QS 3:17-19). This cosmic dualism (absent in earlier Hebrew scripture) makes every ethical choice part of cosmic war.  
- **Communitarian Ethics**: Property is held in common (1QS 1:11-13). Admission requires rigorous examination (1QS 6:13-23). Ethics are **enforced** through community discipline.

**The War Scroll (1QM)**:  
- Apocalyptic militarism. The "sons of light" versus "sons of darkness" (1QM 1:1). Ethics become preparation for holy war. This represents the ultimate sectarian ethic—the community as the only true Israel.

**Temple Scroll (11QT)**:  
- Alternative Torah. Presents ideal Temple regulations and purity laws more stringent than biblical requirements. Ethics become hyper-ritualized, extending Temple purity to the entire "city of the Temple" (11QT 45:11-12).

## 6. The Historical Jesus as Ethical Teacher

**Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)**:  
- **Antitheses** ("You have heard... but I say to you," Matthew 5:21-48): Extends Torah to **intention**, not just action. Anger equals murder (5:22), lust equals adultery (5:28).  
- **Love of Enemies** (Matthew 5:44): Radicalizes Leviticus 19:18 ("love your neighbor"). The Qumran community commanded to **hate** "all the sons of darkness" (1QS 1:10). Jesus' command represents a decisive break.  
- **Non-Retaliation** (Matthew 5:39): Rejects *lex talionis* (Exodus 21:24) as ethical guideline.  
- **Golden Rule** positive formulation (Matthew 7:12): Contrasts with Hillel's negative formulation ("What is hateful to you, do not do to others," b.Shabbat 31a). The positive formulation requires **active** benevolence.

**Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6:20-49)**:  
- More radical economic ethics: "Blessed are you who are poor" (Luke 6:20, not "poor in spirit" as Matthew 5:3).  
- **Continuity with Pharisaism**: Many teachings have parallels—love of neighbor, emphasis on intention. The innovation is in **radicalization** and **universalization**.

**Key Scholar**: **E.P. Sanders** (*Jesus and Judaism*) argues Jesus' ethics must be understood within Jewish restoration eschatology.

## 7. Paul's Universalization: Ethnic Boundaries Removed

**Galatians 3:28**: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male and female."  
- **Ethical Implications**: Covenant community redefined by **faith in Christ**, not ethnic identity or Torah observance. This creates a multi-ethnic ethical community with new boundary markers (baptism, Lord's Supper).

**Romans 13:1-7 vs. Revelation 13**:  
- **Romans**: "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities" (13:1). Authority as God-ordained. This represents an accommodation ethic for a minority community.  
- **Revelation**: The state as beast demanding worship (13:4, 15). Resistance as ethical imperative.  
- **Unresolved Tension**: This dichotomy—accommodation versus resistance—becomes permanent in Christian political ethics.

**Key Scholar**: **N.T. Wright** (*Paul and the Faithfulness of God*) argues Paul reworks Jewish theology around Messiah and Spirit, creating a new basis for ethics.

## 8. Temple Destruction (70 CE): Ethical Watershed

**Rabbinic Judaism's Response**:  
- **Ethical Transformation**: Without Temple, ethics become fully **text-centered** and **communal**. The Mishnah (c. 200 CE) systematically addresses Temple rituals as **memory** and **hope** while establishing *halakha* for home and synagogue.  
- **Innovation**: *Avodah she-ba-lev* ("service of the heart," prayer) replaces sacrifice (b.Ta'anit 2a). Acts of lovingkindness (*gemilut hasadim*) gain atoning power (m.Avot 1:2).

**Christianity's Response**:  
- Interpreted as divine judgment on Temple-based Judaism, vindicating Jesus' prediction (Mark 13:2).  
- Christ's sacrifice becomes the **once-for-all** atonement (Hebrews 9:11-14, 10:10). Christian ethics become fully detached from Temple.

**Key Scholar**: **Daniel Boyarin** (*Border Lines*) shows how both rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity defined themselves against each other after 70 CE.

## 9. The Contested Legacy

The Second Temple period presents not a linear development but **competing ethical trajectories**:

1. **Particularist vs. Universalist**: Sadducee/Pharisee/Essene ethnic covenant vs. Pauline universal community.
2. **Immanent vs. Eschatological**: Proverbs' this-worldly wisdom vs. apocalyptic end-time ethics.
3. **Ritual-Centered vs. Intention-Centered**: Temple purity ethics vs. Jesus' ethics of the heart.
4. **Accommodation vs. Resistance**: Romans 13 vs. Zealot/Revelation ethics.

The destruction of the Temple did not create these divergences but **crystallized** them. Rabbinic Judaism chose the path of **communal survival through textual interpretation**. Christianity chose the path of **universal mission through spiritual transformation**. Islam would later emerge claiming to restore the original Abrahamic ethic beyond both.

**The fork remains unresolved** because it represents fundamentally different answers to: What is the primary locus of divine-human encounter? Temple? Text? Christ? Heart? Community? Each Abrahamic tradition continues to wrestle with these Second Temple options.

### 1. **Jewish Sects: Ethical Disagreements and Covenant Interpretations**
The Second Temple period saw the emergence of competing Jewish sects, each offering distinct ethical readings of the covenant:

- **Pharisees**: Emphasized oral tradition alongside written Torah (Mishnah, *Avot* 1:1) and interpreted the covenant as requiring both legal observance and ethical purity. Their ethical framework stressed *halakha* (legal interpretation) and moral inwardness (Matthew 23:26).
- **Sadducees**: Focused on the written Torah alone and priestly authority (Josephus, *Antiquities* 13.10.6). Their ethics were tied to Temple worship and aristocratic privilege, rejecting afterlife beliefs (Acts 23:8).
- **Essenes**: Practiced radical separatism (Community Rule, *1QS* V, 1-3) and dualistic ethics ("sons of light" vs. "sons of darkness"). The covenant was seen as requiring withdrawal from corrupt society and strict communal discipline.
- **Zealots**: Interpreted the covenant as requiring armed resistance against foreign rule (Josephus, *Jewish War* 2.8.1). Their ethics were militarized, viewing Roman occupation as a violation of divine sovereignty.

Each group’s ethical framework reflects differing priorities: legal interpretation (Pharisees), priestly authority (Sadducees), separatism (Essenes), and political liberation (Zealots).

### 2. **Wisdom Literature: Ethics of Wisdom vs. Law**
The wisdom literature complicates covenantal ethics by introducing universal principles:

- **Proverbs**: Emphasizes practical ethics through fear of Yahweh (Proverbs 1:7) but frames wisdom as accessible to all (Proverbs 8:1-36), not just Israel.
- **Ecclesiastes (Qoheleth)**: Challenges traditional retributive ethics, declaring "all is vanity" (Ecclesiastes 1:2). The covenant is questioned in light of life's unpredictability.
- **Job**: The ultimate challenge to covenant ethics — Job’s suffering despite righteousness (Job 1:1) forces a reckoning with divine justice. Yahweh’s response (Job 38-41) emphasizes mystery over retribution.
- **Sirach (Ben Sira)**: Reaffirms wisdom as rooted in Torah (Sirach 24:23) but introduces Hellenistic influences (e.g., honor-shame ethics).
- **Wisdom of Solomon**: Universalizes wisdom (Wisdom 7:23-24) and introduces Platonic ideas of immortality (Wisdom 3:1-4), shifting ethical focus to the afterlife.

Wisdom literature introduces tension between universal ethics and particularist covenant obligations.

### 3. **Apocalyptic Literature: Eschatological Ethics**
Apocalyptic texts transform ethics by introducing eschatological motivations:

- **Daniel**: Ethical behavior is tied to end-times judgment (Daniel 12:1-3). Perseverance in persecution is emphasized (Daniel 7:25).
- **1 Enoch**: Introduces dualistic ethics (e.g., Watchers’ sin, 1 Enoch 10:11-14) and cosmic battles between good and evil.
- **4 Ezra**: Grapples with theodicy (4 Ezra 3:28-36) and emphasizes repentance in light of impending judgment.

Apocalyptic ethics prioritize faithfulness in anticipation of cosmic transformation, shifting focus from present to future rewards.

### 4. **Hellenistic Influence: Philo and the Septuagint**
Hellenistic thought reshapes Jewish ethics:

- **Philo of Alexandria**: Synthesizes Torah with Platonic and Stoic ethics (*On the Creation* 69-71). For Philo, ethical behavior reflects the Logos (divine reason).
- **Septuagint**: A cultural, not just linguistic, transformation. Greek terms like *agape* (love, LXX Song of Songs 1:4) and *eleos* (mercy, LXX Psalm 25:6) introduce new ethical nuances.

Hellenistic influence universalizes Jewish ethics while introducing philosophical concepts.

### 5. **Dead Sea Scrolls: Essene Ethics**
The Dead Sea Scrolls reveal Essene ethical radicalism:

- **Community Rule (*1QS*)**: Emphasizes communal purity (1QS III, 4-6) and dualistic ethics ("spirit of truth" vs. "spirit of deceit").
- **War Scroll (*1QM*)**: Ethical dualism becomes militarized — the "sons of light" battle the "sons of darkness" (1QM I, 1).
- **Temple Scroll (*11QT*)**: Presents an idealized Torah observance, emphasizing purity and separatism.

Essene ethics reflect a radical interpretation of covenantal obligations.

### 6. **Historical Jesus: Ethical Innovations**
Jesus’ teachings challenge and extend Pharisaic ethics:

- **Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)**: Introduces radical demands — love enemies (Matthew 5:44), practice non-retaliation (Matthew 5:39), and the positive Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12).
- **Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6)**: Emphasizes mercy and reversal of social norms (Luke 6:20-26).

While rooted in Pharisaic tradition, Jesus’ ethics go beyond it, stressing eschatological reversal and unconditional love.

### 7. **Paul: Universalizing the Covenant**
Paul’s theology transforms covenantal ethics:

- **Galatians 3:28**: Removes ethnic boundaries — "Neither Jew nor Gentile." Ethics become universalized.
- **Romans 13 vs. Revelation 13**: Romans 13 advocates submission to authority (Romans 13:1), while Revelation 13 depicts the state as beastly (Revelation 13:1-10). This unresolved tension shapes Christian political ethics.

Paul’s ethics fracture the covenantal framework, emphasizing faith over ethnicity.

### 8. **Destruction of the Temple: Ethical Watershed**
The Temple’s destruction (70 CE) forces ethical reorientation:

- **Rabbinic Judaism**: Replaces Temple worship with Torah study and prayer (*Mishnah, Avot* 1:2). Ethics shift to *halakhic* observance.
- **Christianity**: Interprets the Temple’s destruction as fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecies (Mark 13:2). Ethics become centered on Christ rather than Temple.

Both traditions respond to the trauma by redefining covenantal obligations.

### 9. **Key Scholars**
- **E.P. Sanders**: Reinterprets Paul’s "covenantal nomism" (*Paul and Palestinian Judaism*).
- **N.T. Wright**: Emphasizes narrative and eschatology in New Testament ethics (*Jesus and the Victory of God*).
- **Daniel Boyarin**: Explores Jewish-Christian interactions (*Border Lines*).
- **Gabriele Boccaccini**: Analyzes Second Temple sectarianism (*Beyond the Essene Hypothesis*).

### Conclusion
The Second Temple period is marked by profound ethical divergence. Jewish sects, wisdom literature, apocalypticism, Hellenism, Jesus, Paul, and the Temple’s destruction all contribute to competing ethical frameworks. These tensions, unresolved, define the trajectories of Judaism, Christianity, and eventually Islam.

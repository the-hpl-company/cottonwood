# The Development of Christian Ethics: From Jewish Reform Movement to Imperial Religion (c. 30–312 CE)

## 1. The Sermon on the Mount: Ethical Manifesto and Inversion

**The Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12)** constitute a deliberate inversion of Roman imperial values. "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5) directly counters the Roman *virtus* (manly courage) and the ideology of conquest. In a context where the "blessed" (*makarioi*) were emperors, military victors, and the wealthy, Jesus blesses the poor in spirit, mourners, and the persecuted. As **Dale Allison** notes in *The Sermon on the Mount: Inspiring the Moral Imagination*, this represents "a transvaluation of values" that redefines honor and blessedness in eschatological terms (*The Sermon on the Mount*, 2010, p. 35).

**The Antitheses (Matthew 5:21-48)** present a complex relationship with Mosaic ethics. The formula "You have heard that it was said... But I tell you" (Matthew 5:21-22, 27-28, 31-32, 33-34, 38-39, 43-44) functions as both intensification and transformation. For example:
- On murder: Extends prohibition to anger and insult (Matthew 5:21-22)
- On adultery: Extends prohibition to lustful intent (Matthew 5:27-28)
- On retaliation: Replaces *lex talionis* (Exodus 21:24) with non-resistance (Matthew 5:38-39)
- On love of neighbor: Extends to love of enemies (Matthew 5:43-44)

This represents what **Wayne Meeks** calls "radical interiorization" (*The Moral World of the First Christians*, 1986, p. 138), shifting ethics from external compliance to heart-transformation. The tension remains: Is this a new Torah or the true interpretation of Sinai? Matthew's Jesus explicitly states he came "not to abolish but to fulfill" the Law (Matthew 5:17).

## 2. Parables as Ethical Reasoning

**The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)** responds to the lawyer's question "Who is my neighbor?" (Luke 10:29). By making a Samaritan—a member of a despised ethnic/religious group—the hero, Jesus redefines neighbor-love as crossing ethnic and religious boundaries. The parable concludes with the command "Go and do likewise" (Luke 10:37), establishing an ethic of active, risk-taking compassion rather than boundary-maintenance.

**The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32)** presents forgiveness that appears to violate distributive justice. The younger son's restoration to full status (robe, ring, sandals, feast) without probation period contrasts with the elder son's complaint about never receiving even a goat (Luke 15:29-30). **Elaine Pagels** observes that this parable, like others in Luke, emphasizes "God's mercy toward the undeserving" (*Beyond Belief*, 2003, p. 72), creating tension between grace and merit-based ethics.

**The Sheep and Goats (Matthew 25:31-46)** establishes care for the vulnerable as the criterion for final judgment. The identification of Christ with "the least of these brothers and sisters of mine" (Matthew 25:40, 45) creates what **Larry Hurtado** calls "a startling christological basis for ethics" (*Lord Jesus Christ*, 2003, p. 324). The ethical test is not doctrinal correctness but practical care for the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, and imprisoned.

## 3. Paul's Ethical Framework: Grace, Community, and Accommodation

**Grace vs. Works (Romans 3:21-28; Galatians 2:16)** establishes the theological foundation for Pauline ethics. Paul insists justification comes "by faith apart from works of the law" (Romans 3:28), yet immediately warns against continuing in sin (Romans 6:1-2). This creates the paradox: ethics matter profoundly but cannot earn salvation. In Galatians 5:6, Paul synthesizes: "The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."

**Household Codes (Colossians 3:18-4:1; Ephesians 5:22-6:9)** adopt the Hellenistic *Haustafel* form while transforming its content. Wives submit to husbands "as to the Lord" (Ephesians 5:22), but husbands must love wives "as Christ loved the church" (Ephesians 5:25)—a sacrificial standard. Slaves obey masters "with sincerity of heart" (Colossians 3:22), but masters must provide "what is right and fair" (Colossians 4:1). **Wayne Meeks** argues this represents "neither simple accommodation nor radical transformation but a dialectical relationship with the surrounding culture" (*The First Urban Christians*, 1983, p. 162).

**Love as Supreme Ethic (1 Corinthians 13)** elevates *agapē* as the "most excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31). Without love, even spiritual gifts and martyrdom are worthless (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). This chapter provides the hermeneutic for all Pauline ethics.

**The Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27)** establishes communal ethics. Diversity of gifts serves unity (1 Corinthians 12:4-11), and the suffering or honor of one member affects all (1 Corinthians 12:26). This metaphor counters individualistic spirituality with an ethic of mutual dependence.

## 4. The Didache: Early Manual of Christian Practice

**The Two Ways (Didache 1-6)** presents "the way of life" versus "the way of death" (Didache 1:1; 5:1), continuing a Jewish tradition (cf. Jeremiah 21:8; Psalms 1). The ethical teaching combines Jesus' sayings (including a version of the Golden Rule in negative form: "Do not do to others what you would not have done to you," Didache 1:2) with practical instructions on almsgiving (1:5-6), prayer (8:2-3), and fasting (8:1).

**Revealed Practices**: The Didache shows early communities grappling with:
- Hospitality limits: Visitors may stay 2-3 days maximum; if they want to settle, they must work (12:2-5)
- Eucharistic prayers with ethical content: "As this broken bread was scattered... and was gathered... so may your church be gathered" (9:4)
- Correction procedures: "Correct one another... but not in anger" (15:3)

This manual reveals Christianity developing from charismatic movement toward institutionalized practice while maintaining apocalyptic urgency.

## 5. Martyrdom as Ethical Witness

**The Martyr Acts** (e.g., *Martyrdom of Polycarp*, c. 155-156 CE; *Acts of Perpetua and Felicitas*, c. 203 CE) present death as the ultimate ethical witness. Polycarp's declaration "Eighty-six years I have served Christ, and he never did me any wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?" (*Martyrdom of Polycarp* 9:3) exemplifies the ethical logic: loyalty to God supersedes all earthly obligations.

**Tertullian's** famous statement "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church" (*Apologeticus* 50:13) captures how martyrdom became an ethical argument for Christianity's truth. As **Larry Hurtado** notes, martyrdom represented "the ultimate expression of exclusive devotion to the one God" (*Destroyer of the gods*, 2016, p. 145), creating an ethic of resistance to imperial claims of ultimate allegiance.

## 6. Early Church Debates as Ethical Disagreements

**Gnosticism** (e.g., Valentinians, Sethians) treated the material world as evil or inferior, leading to two ethical extremes: ascetic rejection of the body (Gospel of Thomas 27: "If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the kingdom") or libertine disregard for physical actions (since only spiritual knowledge mattered). Irenaeus countered with creation-affirming ethics: "The glory of God is a living human being" (*Against Heresies* 4.20.7).

**Montanism** (late 2nd century) emphasized continuing prophecy and strict ethics, including prohibition of remarriage after spouse's death and increased fasting. Its ethical rigor appealed to those dissatisfied with institutional accommodation but was condemned as "new prophecy" that disrupted church order.

**Donatism** (4th century, post-persecution) argued that sacraments administered by clergy who had surrendered scriptures during persecution (*traditores*) were invalid. This created an ethic of priestly purity versus Augustine's response that sacraments derive efficacy from Christ, not the minister's worthiness—a crucial distinction with profound ethical consequences for how the church understands itself as simultaneously holy and sinful.

## 7. Constantine and the Ethics of Establishment

**The Edict of Milan (313 CE)** granted religious toleration, ending persecution but beginning what **Wayne Meeks** calls "the ambiguous legacy of establishment" (*The Origins of Christian Morality*, 1993, p. 212). The ethics of a persecuted minority—non-retaliation, separation from "the world," readiness for martyrdom—became problematic for an imperial religion.

**The Nicene Creed (325 CE)** established orthodox Christology but had ethical consequences:
- Uniform doctrine enabled uniform ethics across the empire
- Heretics could now be persecuted by Christian emperors (contra earlier Christian appeals for toleration)
- The church's identification with imperial power created what **Elaine Pagels** terms "the politics of monotheism" (*Adam, Eve, and the Serpent*, 1988, p. 114)—one God, one emperor, one church

The ethical shift was profound: Augustine would later develop just war theory (*City of God* 19.7) and coercion of heretics (*Letters* 93, 185)—unthinkable for pre-Constantinian Christians.

## 8. Desert Monasticism as Counter-Ethic

**Anthony of Egypt** (c. 251-356) and **Pachomius** (c. 292-348) established monasticism as an alternative to imperial Christianity. The *Sayings of the Desert Fathers* (*Apophthegmata Patrum*) preserve their ethics:
- "A brother asked Abba Poemen, 'How should I behave in my cell?' He replied, 'Be as a stranger in a foreign land'" (Poemen 40)
- "Abba Antony said, 'Whoever hammers a lump of iron... first decides what he is going to make of it'" (Antony 2)

**The Ethics of Withdrawal** represented both protest against and purification of the established church. As **Dale Allison** observes, desert spirituality maintained the "eschatological tension" that establishment Christianity risked losing (*The Luminous Dusk*, 2006, p. 89). Monasticism preserved the radical ethics of discipleship while the imperial church developed ethics for Christian citizens.

## Conclusion: From Jewish Sect to Imperial Religion

The ethical trajectory from Jesus to Constantine reveals multiple tensions that would define Christianity:

1. **Eschatology vs. Institution**: The early expectation of imminent kingdom (Mark 1:15) yielded to institutional structures for the long term (1 Timothy 3:1-13).

2. **Radical Discipleship vs. General Morality**: The Sermon on the Mount's impossible ideals (be perfect as God is perfect, Matthew 5:48) coexisted with pastoral accommodation (Paul's "because of your hardness of heart" concessions, cf. 1 Corinthians 7:6).

3. **Love as Transformation vs. Love as Order**: The subversive love of enemies (Matthew 5:44) existed alongside love as social stabilizer in household codes.

4. **Martyrdom as Witness vs. Martyrdom as Problem**: Willingness to die for faith was admirable until Christianity became legal, requiring new ethics of citizenship.

By 312 CE, Christianity contained within itself both the ethics of the persecuted sect and the ethics of imperial religion—a tension that would produce both monastic withdrawal and Christendom's synthesis of cross and crown.

# Medieval Abrahamic Ethics: Parallel Developments & Cross-Pollination (400–1500 CE)

## 1. **Augustine of Hippo (354–430): Foundations of Western Christian Ethics**
- **Just War Theory**: First systematic criteria for permissible violence in *Contra Faustum* 22.74–78: just cause (response to injury), right intention (peace, not conquest), proper authority (not private vendetta), proportionality. In *City of God* XIX.7, he argues peace is the true desire even in war.
- **Original Sin & Grace**: *Confessions* VIII.5–12 details his ethical powerlessness without grace; *City of God* XIII.14–15 establishes inherited guilt from Adam, making human virtue dependent on divine gift (Romans 5:12 exegesis).
- **Two Cities Ethics**: *City of God* XIV.28 distinguishes *civitas Dei* (love of God to contempt of self) from *civitas terrena* (love of self to contempt of God) as competing ethical teleologies. Political authority is necessary but provisional (XIX.17).
- **Ethics of Interiority**: *Confessions* X.27–38 models ethical self-examination as a journey into memory and desire, where sin is disordered love (*amor*).

## 2. **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274): Synthesis of Reason & Revelation**
- **Natural Law**: *Summa Theologica* I-II, q.91, a.2: eternal law → natural law (synderesis: “good to be done, evil avoided”) → human law. Natural law is participation in God’s wisdom, knowable by reason.
- **Virtue Ethics Synthesis**: I-II, qq.55–67: Infused theological virtues (faith, hope, charity) perfect acquired cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, temperance, courage). Charity unifies all virtues (II-II, q.23, a.8).
- **The Five Ways & Ethics**: The proofs (I, q.2, a.3) ground ethics in final causality: all beings incline toward their ends, with human *telos* in beatific vision (I-II, q.3, a.8).
- **Graduated Ethics**: Distinguishes eternal, natural, human, and divine law (I-II, q.91), creating a layered ethical framework where reason and revelation cooperate.

## 3. **Orthodox Theosis: Ethics as Deification**
- **Cappadocian Framework**: Gregory of Nyssa’s *Life of Moses* frames virtue as infinite ascent (*epektasis*) toward God. Basil’s *Longer Rules* tie ascetic practice to communal love.
- **Maximus the Confessor**: *Ambigua* 7: ethics as healing the passions to restore natural will’s alignment with God; *Centuries on Charity* links love with contemplative knowledge.
- **Philokalia Tradition** (compiled 18th c., but medieval roots): Ethical life as *praxis* (purification) → *theoria* (illumination) → *theosis* (union). Differs from Western legalism by treating commandments as therapeutic, not forensic.
- **Key Distinction**: While Western ethics often focus on right action (*recte agere*), Orthodox ethics focus on becoming “partakers of divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4).

## 4. **Islamic Legal-Ethical Framework (Fiqh & Maqasid)**
- **Quranic Ethics**: Surah al-Isra’ 17:23–39: graduated commands from worship to interpersonal conduct. Surah al-Hujurat 49:9–13 grounds conflict resolution in justice and reconciliation.
- **Prophetic Exemplarity**: Hadith collections (Bukhari, Muslim) provide *Sunnah* as living interpretation. E.g., Bukhari 1:2: “Actions are by intentions” internalizes ethics.
- **Fivefold Classification** (*al-ahkam al-khamsa*): *Wajib* (obligatory), *mustahabb* (recommended), *mubah* (permissible), *makruh* (discouraged), *haram* (forbidden) creates a spectrum beyond binary halal/haram.
- ***Maqasid al-Shariah***: Articulated by al-Ghazali (*al-Mustasfa*) and systematized by al-Shatibi (*al-Muwafaqat*): preservation of *din, nafs, aql, nasl, mal* (religion, life, intellect, lineage, property) as higher objectives.

## 5. **Islamic Philosophy (*Falsafa*) & the Revelation-Reason Tension**
- **Al-Farabi** (*Attainment of Happiness*): Ethics as political science aiming at civic virtue; philosopher-prophet as lawgiver synthesizing Greek and Islamic ideals.
- **Ibn Sina (Avicenna)** (*Healing, Metaphysics*): Ethics grounded in emanationist cosmology; virtue as soul’s purification for conjunction with Active Intellect.
- **Ibn Rushd (Averroes)** (*Decisive Treatise*): Argues for philosophical and scriptural paths to same truth; *Commentary on Plato’s Republic* adapts Greek virtue ethics to Islamic context.
- **Al-Ghazali’s Critique**: *Tahafut al-Falasifah* attacks philosophers’ metaphysical claims but retains Aristotelian logic and ethics in moderated form. His *Ihya* integrates philosophical ethics within Sufi-legal framework.

## 6. **Sufi Ethics: Interiorization & Love**
- **Al-Ghazali’s *Ihya Ulum al-Din***: 40 books systematizing *shariah*’s inner dimensions (e.g., Book 20 on love, longing, intimacy).
- **Rumi** (*Mathnawi*): Ethical stories transforming legal duty into love-crazed surrender. “The religion of love is beyond all faiths” (Dīvān-e Shams 110).
- **Ibn Arabi** (*Bezels of Wisdom*): Ethics of unity (*wahdat al-wujud*): “He loves them and they love Him” (Quran 5:54) becomes mutual indwelling; virtue as realizing one’s divine origin.

## 7. **Cross-Pollination: Translation, Dialogue, Conflict**
- **Aristotelian Transmission**: Arabic translations (Bayt al-Hikma) → Ibn Rushd’s commentaries → Latin translations (Toledo School) → Aquinas. Aquinas cites “Averroes” 500+ times but critiques his monopsychism.
- **Jewish-Islamic Dialogue**: Maimonides (*Guide for the Perplexed*) written in Arabic, using Avicennian metaphysics and Alfarabian political philosophy to reconcile Torah with reason.
- **Crusades as Ethical Crisis**: All three traditions developed *jihad*/just war/holy war theories in dialectical opposition. Usama ibn Munqidh’s *Memoirs* and chronicles of Saladin show Muslim counter-ethics; Jewish responsa (e.g., *Maharam of Rothenburg*) address survival under both sides.
- **Scholarly Networks**: Jewish translators (Ibn Tibbon family) mediated Arabic-to-Hebrew-to-Latin flows; Dominican scholars (Albertus Magnus) engaged Andalusian sources.

## 8. **Mystical Ethics: Parallel Interior Journeys**
- **Kabbalah** (*Zohar*, 13th c.): Ethics as restoring divine flow (*shefa*) through human action (*tikkun olam*). Commandments become cosmic acts.
- **Christian Mysticism**: Meister Eckhart’s sermons (German Sermon 52) on detachment (*Abgeschiedenheit*) and birth of God in soul; Julian of Norwich (*Revelations of Divine Love*) on sin as pedagogical, not forensic.
- **Shared Substrate**: Neoplatonic emanationism (Plotinus → Arabic *Theology of Aristotle* → all three traditions); apophatic theology (Pseudo-Dionysius → Ibn Arabi → Kabbalah).
- **Critical Difference**: Christian mysticism centers on Christ’s humanity; Sufism on Muhammad’s light (*nur muhammadiyya*); Kabbalah on Torah’s infinite letters.

## 9. **Key Modern Scholars & Interpretive Frames**
- **Alasdair MacIntyre** (*Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*): Treats Aquinas as synthesizing Augustinian and Aristotelian traditions into a coherent ethical tradition.
- **Wael Hallaq** (*A History of Islamic Legal Theories*): Traces *maqasid* as internal critique within *fiqh*, emphasizing moral objectives over legal literalism.
- **Seyyed Hossein Nasr** (*Knowledge and the Sacred*): Argues for perennial wisdom (*sophia perennis*) across Abrahamic mystical traditions.
- **Tariq Ramadan** (*Radical Reform*): Advocates *maqasid*-based renewal, linking medieval frameworks to contemporary ethics.
- **David Burrell** (*Knowing the Unknowable God*): Compares Aquinas and Ibn Sina on divine attributes, highlighting interfaith philosophical dialogue.

## **Internal Tensions & Contested Legacies**
- **Grace vs. Law**: Augustine’s emphasis on original sin (Council of Carthage, 418) contrasts with Orthodox *synergia* and Islam’s *fitra* (innate human goodness, Quran 30:30).
- **Philosophy vs. Revelation**: Al-Ghazali’s *Tahafut* versus Ibn Rushd’s *Tahafut al-Tahafut*; Latin Averroism condemned in 1277 Paris Condemnations.
- **Mysticism vs. Orthodoxy**: Eckhart condemned (1329); Ibn Arabi debated; Kabbalah marginalized by *mitnagdim*.
- **Transmission Disputes**: Extent of Islamic influence on Aquinas debated (e.g., Richard Taylor vs. Mark Jordan); actual Greek texts vs. Arabic intermediaries.

---

**Conclusion**: The medieval period saw all three traditions develop **parallel graduated ethical systems** (natural law/*maqasid*/virtue ethics), **interiorized mystical ethics**, and **legal-theological syntheses**, while continuously engaging each other through translation, polemic, and shared philosophical heritage. The Crusades represent not only conflict but also intensified mutual definition, where each tradition articulated its ethics in conscious distinction from—and dialogue with—the others.

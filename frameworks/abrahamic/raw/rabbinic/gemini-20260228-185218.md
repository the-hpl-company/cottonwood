Here is a survey of Rabbinic Jewish ethics, tracing its development from the Second Temple period through the modern era.

### The Mishnah (~200 CE)

Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Rabbinic Judaism shifted the focus of Jewish life from Temple-based ritual to Torah study, prayer, and ethical action. The Mishnah, compiled by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi around 200 CE, is the first major written collection of the Oral Torah. It serves as the foundation for the Talmud.

*   **Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the Fathers):** This tractate, unique for its explicit focus on ethics, outlines principles for righteous living and leadership. Its famous dictum, "On three things the world stands: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving-kindness" (Avot 1:2), establishes a framework for Jewish life centered on study, devotion, and ethical action. Pirkei Avot emphasizes character development, humility, and the pursuit of justice. It identifies specific virtues and vices, offering practical guidance for daily life. For example, Hillel's teachings, such as "Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place" (Avot 2:4), promote empathy and understanding.
*   **The Tractates of Damages (Nezikin):** The tractates Bava Kamma, Bava Metzia, and Bava Batra (collectively known as Nezikin) deal extensively with civil law, property rights, and interpersonal harm. They cover topics such as:
    *   **Bava Kamma (First Gate):** Deals with torts, damages to property and person, and the responsibility of individuals for their actions. It covers topics like animal damage, fire damage, and personal injury.
    *   **Bava Metzia (Middle Gate):** Addresses issues of lost and found objects, bailments, labor laws, and fair business practices. It emphasizes honesty, integrity, and the protection of the vulnerable.
    *   **Bava Batra (Last Gate):** Focuses on property rights, inheritance laws, partnerships, and neighborhood disputes. It seeks to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation in economic and social interactions.

These tractates demonstrate the Rabbis' commitment to creating a just and orderly society based on principles of fairness, compassion, and responsibility.

### The Talmud: Bavli and Yerushalmi

The Talmud is a multi-layered commentary on the Mishnah. Two versions exist: the Babylonian Talmud (Bavli) and the Jerusalem Talmud (Yerushalmi). Both contain legal discussions (halakha) and narrative material (aggadah).

*   **Ethical Method: Argument as Worship:** The Talmudic method of learning and legal reasoning is characterized by vigorous debate and the exploration of multiple perspectives. Disagreement ("machloket") is not viewed as a negative phenomenon but as a means of arriving at truth. The phrase "machloket l'shem shamayim" (disagreement for the sake of heaven) describes disputes conducted with sincerity and a desire to understand God's will.
*   **Preservation of Minority Opinions:** Even when a majority opinion is established, the Talmud often preserves minority views, demonstrating a commitment to intellectual honesty and the recognition that truth may be multifaceted. The classic example is the dispute between the schools of Hillel and Shammai (Beit Hillel vs. Beit Shammai), where the Talmud often records both opinions, even though the halakha generally follows Beit Hillel.
*   **Anti-Flattening Architecture:** The Talmud's structure actively resists flattening diverse viewpoints into a single, monolithic position. It maintains complexity and acknowledges the inherent tensions within Jewish tradition. This architecture reflects a commitment to ongoing dialogue and the recognition that ethical questions often lack simple answers.

### Pikuach Nefesh: Saving a Life

*Pikuach nefesh* (saving a life) is a central principle in Jewish law and ethics, overriding nearly all other commandments (Shabbat 132a). This principle demonstrates the high value placed on human life and the imperative to act decisively to preserve it.

*   **Ethical Hierarchy:** *Pikuach nefesh* creates a clear ethical hierarchy, prioritizing the preservation of life above most ritual obligations. For example, one is permitted to violate the Sabbath to save a life. This principle reflects the belief that human life is sacred and that preserving it takes precedence over almost all other concerns.
*   **Talmudic Sources:** The Talmud derives *pikuach nefesh* from verses such as "You shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, which a man shall do and live by them" (Leviticus 18:5), interpreting "live by them" to mean that the commandments are meant to enhance life, not endanger it. Maimonides codifies this principle, stating that violating the Sabbath to save a life is not merely permissible but obligatory (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Shabbat 2:1).

### Tikkun Olam: Repair of the World

*Tikkun olam* (repair of the world) has become a central concept in modern Jewish ethics, but its meaning has evolved over time.

*   **Original Narrow Legal Meaning:** In early Rabbinic literature, *tikkun olam* referred to specific legal enactments designed to promote social order and prevent injustice. These enactments were often temporary measures intended to address particular circumstances. For example, the Mishnah discusses *tikkun olam* in the context of debt collection and ensuring fair treatment for creditors (Gittin 4:3).
*   **Modern Expansive Ethical Meaning:** In modern times, *tikkun olam* has expanded to encompass a broad range of social justice issues, including environmentalism, human rights, and economic equality. This expanded understanding of *tikkun olam* reflects a desire to apply Jewish ethical principles to contemporary challenges and to create a more just and compassionate world.
*   **Transformation of the Concept:** The transformation of *tikkun olam* from a narrow legal term to a broad ethical concept reflects the influence of modern social and political movements, as well as a renewed emphasis on the prophetic tradition's call for justice.

### Maimonides (Rambam): Mishneh Torah and Guide for the Perplexed

Maimonides (1138-1204), also known as Rambam, was a towering figure in Jewish intellectual history. His works synthesized Jewish law, philosophy, and ethics, profoundly shaping Jewish thought.

*   **Mishneh Torah as Systematic Ethics:** Maimonides' *Mishneh Torah* is a comprehensive codification of Jewish law, organized by topic. It includes not only legal rulings but also ethical teachings and philosophical reflections. For example, his discussion of *tzedakah* (charity) includes eight levels, ranging from giving grudgingly to helping someone become self-sufficient (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:7-14). This demonstrates Maimonides' emphasis on intention and the importance of empowering recipients of charity.
*   **Guide for the Perplexed:** In *The Guide for the Perplexed*, Maimonides sought to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Jewish theology. He addressed philosophical questions about God's nature, divine attributes, and the problem of evil. Maimonides argued that reason and revelation are compatible and that philosophical inquiry can deepen one's understanding of Jewish faith. He provides ethical guidance, emphasizing the importance of cultivating virtues such as wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.
*   **Synthesis of Aristotelian and Jewish Ethics:** Maimonides integrates Aristotelian ethical concepts, such as the Golden Mean, into his Jewish ethical framework. He believed that by cultivating virtuous character traits, individuals could achieve moral perfection and draw closer to God.

### Nachmanides (Ramban) and the Mystical Ethical Tradition

Nachmanides (1194-1270), also known as Ramban, was a leading Jewish scholar, mystic, and commentator. His commentary on the Torah, his mystical writings, and his ethical teachings profoundly influenced Jewish thought.

*   **Kabbalah's Ethical Implications:** Nachmanides integrated Kabbalistic ideas into his ethical teachings, emphasizing the importance of intention and the interconnectedness of all things. He believed that human actions have cosmic consequences and that by performing mitzvot (commandments) with the right intention, individuals can help restore harmony to the universe.
*   **The Zohar:** The Zohar, a central text of Kabbalah, explores the mystical dimensions of Jewish tradition, offering symbolic interpretations of biblical narratives and legal precepts. The Zohar emphasizes the importance of love, compassion, and selflessness in achieving spiritual perfection. It teaches that ethical action is not merely a matter of following rules but of transforming one's inner being.
*   **Mystical Theology Reshapes Ethics:** Kabbalistic theology reshapes ethics by emphasizing the hidden dimensions of human action. It teaches that ethical choices have profound effects on the spiritual realms, influencing the flow of divine energy and the well-being of the cosmos. This mystical perspective adds a layer of depth and meaning to ethical decision-making.

### The Musar Movement

The Musar movement, which emerged in 19th-century Lithuania, emphasized ethical self-improvement through systematic cultivation of *middot* (ethical character traits).

*   **Rabbi Israel Salanter:** Rabbi Israel Salanter (1810-1883) was the founder of the Musar movement. He believed that ethical development required rigorous self-examination, introspection, and practical exercises. Salanter emphasized the importance of confronting one's flaws and cultivating virtues such as humility, honesty, and compassion.
*   **Systematic Cultivation of Middot:** The Musar movement developed a range of techniques for cultivating *middot*, including studying ethical texts, meditating on moral principles, and engaging in self-assessment. Musar practitioners often kept journals to track their progress and identify areas for improvement. The movement's emphasis on practical techniques and measurable progress made ethics a tangible and achievable goal.

### Modern Jewish Ethics

Modern Jewish ethics encompasses a diverse range of perspectives, drawing on traditional sources and engaging with contemporary philosophical and social issues.

*   **Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics as First Philosophy:** Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) argued that ethics is not derived from metaphysics but is the foundation of all philosophy. He emphasized the ethical significance of the "face of the Other," arguing that the encounter with another person demands a response of responsibility and care.
*   **Martin Buber: I-Thou:** Martin Buber (1878-1965) distinguished between "I-It" relationships, which are based on utility and objectification, and "I-Thou" relationships, which are based on genuine encounter and mutual respect. He argued that authentic human existence requires cultivating "I-Thou" relationships with God, other people, and the world.
*   **Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Ethics Applied to Civil Rights:** Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) applied the prophetic tradition's call for justice to the civil rights movement, advocating for racial equality and social justice. He argued that religious faith demands ethical action and that indifference to injustice is a form of complicity.
*   **Joseph Soloveitchik: Halakhic Man:** Joseph Soloveitchik (1903-1993) explored the ethical implications of Jewish law in his essay "Halakhic Man." He argued that Halakha provides a framework for ethical decision-making and that by living according to its principles, individuals can achieve spiritual fulfillment.

### Key Tension: Halakha and Aggadah

The relationship between *halakha* (law) and *aggadah* (narrative/ethical teaching) is a central tension in Jewish thought.

*   **Are They Separable?:** Some argue that *halakha* and *aggadah* are distinct domains, with *halakha* providing the legal framework for Jewish life and *aggadah* offering ethical and spiritual insights. Others argue that *halakha* and *aggadah* are inseparable, with *aggadah* providing the ethical context for understanding and interpreting *halakha*.
*   **The Debate Continues:** The debate over the relationship between *halakha* and *aggadah* continues to shape Jewish thought and practice. Some modern Jewish thinkers emphasize the importance of integrating ethical considerations into legal decision-making, while others maintain the primacy of *halakha* as the ultimate source of authority.

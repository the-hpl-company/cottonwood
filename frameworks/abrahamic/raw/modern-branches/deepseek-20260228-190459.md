# Modern Developments in Abrahamic Ethics (c. 1800–Present)

## 1. Catholic Social Teaching: From Labor Rights to Integral Ecology
Catholic Social Teaching (CST) represents the most systematic modern development of Christian ethics within an institutional framework, evolving through papal encyclicals and conciliar documents.

- **Rerum Novarum** (Leo XIII, 1891): Grounded in natural law and Thomistic reasoning, it asserts workers’ rights to just wages (§45), unionize (§49), and private property (§15), while rejecting both laissez-faire capitalism and class struggle socialism. The ethical pivot: *labor is not a commodity*.
- **Pacem in Terris** (John XXIII, 1963): First encyclical addressed to “all people of good will.” Establishes a universal human rights framework based on human dignity (§§9–27), extending to nuclear disarmament (§§109–119). Key development: rights are *inalienable* because grounded in natural law.
- **Gaudium et Spes** (Vatican II, 1965): The “Church in the Modern World” constitution. Introduces *historical consciousness* into Catholic ethics—the “signs of the times” must be discerned (§4). Affirms autonomy of earthly affairs (§36) while calling for solidarity (§66).
- **Laudato Si’** (Francis, 2015): “Integral ecology” linking care for the poor and care for creation (§§49, 139). Critiques the “technocratic paradigm” (§§101–114). Explicitly frames environmental degradation as a *moral and spiritual crisis*, not merely technical.
- **Preferential Option for the Poor**: First articulated at Medellín (1968), formally adopted in **Sollicitudo Rei Socialis** (John Paul II, 1987, §42). Not exclusionary but a hermeneutical priority: social policy must be evaluated from the standpoint of the marginalized.

**Key Scholar**: David Hollenbach (*Claims in Conflict*, 1979) traces CST’s shift from natural law to human rights via dignity.

## 2. Liberation Theology: God Takes Sides
Emerging from Latin America in the 1960s–70s, liberation theology represents the most radical ethical challenge to both secular development models and ecclesiastical complacency.

- **Gustavo Gutiérrez**, *A Theology of Liberation* (1971): Defines liberation on three levels: political, historical, and spiritual (pp. 36–37). The ethical core: *praxis precedes theory*—orthopraxis over orthodoxy. The Exodus is the paradigmatic narrative of God liberating the oppressed.
- **Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs)**: Lay-led Bible study groups that practiced “see-judge-act” methodology, reading Scripture through the lens of poverty. Example: The Exodus narrative read as God’s preferential option for slaves.
- **Tension with Vatican Authority**: The **Instruction on Certain Aspects of the ‘Theology of Liberation’** (CDF, 1984) criticized Marxist analysis and reduction of salvation to politics. **Libertatis Conscientia** (1986) affirmed a “theologically correct” option for the poor but rejected class struggle.
- **Legacy**: Jon Sobrino’s Christology (*Jesus the Liberator*, 1991) presents Jesus as the “Crucified People,” identifying suffering with the poor.

**Internal Tension**: Liberation theology’s use of Marxist social analysis versus Vatican insistence on transcendental hope.

## 3. The Social Gospel: Christianity as Social Transformation
A primarily North American Protestant movement (c. 1880–1925) responding to industrialization and urban poverty.

- **Walter Rauschenbusch**, *Christianity and the Social Crisis* (1907): Argues the Kingdom of God is not merely individual salvation but a *social order* embodying justice and love (Ch. 1). The prophets and Jesus’ teachings demand structural change.
- **Ethical Method**: Applied Jesus’ ethical teachings (Sermon on the Mount) directly to social institutions—factories, legislatures, cities.
- **Influence on Civil Rights**: Martin Luther King Jr. explicitly cited Rauschenbusch in *Stride Toward Freedom* (1958, p. 73) as shaping his understanding of social sin.

**Limitation**: Often criticized for theological liberalism and over-optimism about social progress.

## 4. Martin Luther King Jr.: Synthesis of Prophetic Ethics
King’s ethical framework is a deliberate synthesis of multiple traditions, making it uniquely potent for civil rights activism.

- **Sources**:
  1. **Black Church Tradition**: The Exodus and prophetic justice (Amos 5:24, “Let justice roll down like waters”).
  2. **Gandhian Satyagraha**: Nonviolence as active resistance, not passivity.
  3. **Personalist Philosophy** (Boston University): The inherent dignity of every person.
  4. **Social Gospel**: Structural sin requires structural redemption.
- **Letter from Birmingham Jail** (1963): A masterclass in applied prophetic ethics. Justifies civil disobedience by appealing to Augustine: “an unjust law is no law at all” (cf. *De Libero Arbitrio*). The famous line—“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”—frames ethics as *interconnected*.
- **Later Development**: The **Poor People’s Campaign** (1968) expanded the ethical concern from civil rights to economic rights, showing the “inseparable twin” of racism and poverty.

**Key Scholar**: James Cone (*Martin & Malcolm & America*, 1991) places King within Black liberation theology.

## 5. Islamic Reform Movements: Modernity and Revival
Modern Islamic ethics grapples with colonialism, secularism, and pluralism through two main streams: modernist reform and Islamist revival.

- **Muhammad Abduh (d. 1905)** and **Rashid Rida (d. 1935)**: *Al-Manar* journal. Argued for reopening *ijtihad* (independent reasoning) to reconcile Islam with modern science and constitutional government. Abduh’s *Risalat al-Tawhid* emphasizes reason’s role in understanding God’s law.
- **Sayyid Qutb**, *Milestones* (1964): Presents a radical break. *Jahiliyyah* (pre-Islamic ignorance) now describes *all* contemporary societies, including Muslim ones. Ethics becomes binary: God’s sovereignty (*hakimiyya*) versus human rebellion. Violent jihad is justified to establish divine rule.
- **Contemporary Islamic Ethics**:
  - **Tariq Ramadan**: “Critical loyalty” to both Islamic tradition and Western citizenship. Argues for a “European Islam” that contributes to the common good.
  - **Khaled Abou El Fadl**: *Speaking in God’s Name* (2001) critiques authoritarian interpretations. Uses classical *usul al-fiqh* (legal theory) to argue for mercy as central to God’s law.
  - **Amina Wadud**: *Qur’an and Woman* (1992) performs a *gender-inclusive* tafsir. Her 2005 mixed-gender Friday prayer service enacted a feminist ethical critique of ritual practice.

**Tension**: Reformists seek *adaptation* to modernity; revivalists seek *purification* from modernity.

## 6. Jewish Renewal and Post-Holocaust Ethics
Modern Jewish ethics confronts the Holocaust, pluralism, and environmental crisis.

- **Reconstructionism (Mordecai Kaplan)**: Judaism as a *civilization*, not just a religion. Ethics evolve through the “sancta” of the Jewish people. *God is the power that makes for salvation*—a naturalistic, functional definition.
- **Post-Holocaust Ethics**:
  - **Emil Fackenheim**: The **614th Commandment** (1967): Jews must not give Hitler a “posthumous victory” by abandoning Judaism. The ethical imperative: *Jewish survival as a moral act*.
  - **Richard Rubenstein**: *After Auschwitz* (1966) argues the Holocaust shattered the covenant theology; only power matters.
- **Jewish Environmental Ethics**: Expands **bal tashchit** (“do not destroy,” Deuteronomy 20:19–20) from wartime prohibition to ecological principle. **Arthur Waskow** (*The Torah of the Earth*, 2000) develops eco-kashrut and Sabbath as earth-rest.

**Key Scholar**: Eugene Borowitz (*Renewing the Covenant*, 1991) navigates between autonomy and tradition in liberal Jewish ethics.

## 7. Feminist and Womanist Theology: Gender as Ethical Critique
Feminist theology exposes androcentrism in tradition; womanist theology centers Black women’s experience.

- **Rosemary Radford Ruether**, *Sexism and God-Talk* (1983): The “critical principle” of feminist theology is the *full humanity of women*. Whatever denies this is not redemptive. Reconstructs Christology beyond gender.
- **Delores Williams**, *Sisters in the Wilderness* (1993): Womanist ethics focuses on *survival and quality of life* for Black women, using Hagar’s story (Genesis 16, 21). Critique of atonement theories that glorify suffering.
- **Amina Wadud** (Islamic): *Inside the Gender Jihad* (2006) argues for *taqwa* (God-consciousness) as the basis for gender justice, not Western feminism.
- **Impact**: All three traditions now have internal feminist debates over:
  - **Scriptural interpretation**: Reclaiming marginalized texts (e.g., the women disciples in the Gospels).
  - **Law**: Reinterpreting *halakha*, *sharia*, and canon law on marriage, divorce, testimony.
  - **Leadership**: Women’s ordination (resolved in Reform Judaism, unresolved in Catholicism and mainstream Sunni Islam).

## 8. Interfaith Ethics: Convergence or Distinctiveness?
Post-Holocaust and post-colonial interfaith dialogue seeks common ground while respecting difference.

- **Nostra Aetate** (Vatican II, 1965): Repudiates deicide charge against Jews (§4), affirms God’s covenant with Israel remains valid. Opens door to recognizing “rays of truth” in other religions (§2).
- **The Amman Message** (2004): A Sunni consensus document defining who is a Muslim, condemning *takfir* (excommunication), and promoting intra-Muslim tolerance. An ethical response to sectarian violence.
- **Hans Küng**, *Global Responsibility* (1991): “No world peace without religious peace.” Proposes a *global ethic* based on the Golden Rule and principles of nonviolence, solidarity, and tolerance.
- **Parliament of World Religions** (1893, revived 1993): Produced the **Declaration Toward a Global Ethic** (1993) signed by religious leaders across traditions.

**Tension**: Küng’s project is criticized by **Saba Mahmood** (*Religious Difference in a Secular Age*, 2015) for imposing liberal Protestant assumptions (individual conscience, privatized faith) as universal.

## 9. Unresolved Tensions: Live Debates
- **Abortion**: Catholic magisterium holds life begins at conception (*Donum Vitae*, 1987); Reform Judaism permits abortion under broad circumstances (CCAR Responsa); Sunni Islam generally permits it before ensoulment (often 120 days), but schools differ.
- **Sexuality**: The **United Methodist Church** split (2024) over LGBTQ inclusion. Orthodox Judaism prohibits homosexual acts; Reform Judaism celebrates same-sex marriage. Islam largely prohibits, with emerging queer-inclusive readings (Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, *Homosexuality in Islam*, 2010).
- **Women’s Ordination**: Catholic magisterium declares the matter closed (*Ordinatio Sacerdotalis*, 1994). Anglican Communion fractured over it. Sunni Islam prohibits female imams for mixed congregations; Shi’a Islam permits *mujtahidahs* (female jurists).
- **Religious Law vs. Civil Law**: *Halakha* in Israel (Who is a Jew?); *Sharia* in Western courts (UK Sharia councils); Canon law and religious liberty conflicts (US *Hobby Lobby* case).

## 10. Key Scholars Shaping the Conversation
- **Cornel West**: *Prophetic pragmatism*—ethics must combine deep tradition with radical democratic critique.
- **Charles Taylor**: *A Secular Age* (2007) maps the conditions for modern religious belief, arguing for “open” vs. “closed” immanent frames.
- **Saba Mahmood**: Critiques liberal secularism’s regulation of religion; defends piety as ethical agency.
- **Jeffrey Stout**: *Democracy and Tradition* (2004) argues democratic ethics can draw on religious traditions without established religion.

---

**Conclusion: The Tradition as Lively Argument**
The Abrahamic traditions are not museum pieces but ongoing ethical conversations marked by:
1. **Internal pluralism** (e.g., Reform vs. Orthodox Judaism, liberation theology vs. Vatican magisterium).
2. **Cross-pollination** (King drawing on Gandhi, Islamic modernists engaging European philosophy).
3. **Radical breaks** (post-Holocaust Judaism, Islamist rejection of modernity).
4. **New frontiers** (ecological ethics, bioethics, digital ethics).

What unites them is the persistent claim that *revelation matters for how we live together*—even as they fiercely disagree on what that revelation demands. The ethical frameworks are alive precisely because they are arguing—with modernity, with each other, and with themselves.

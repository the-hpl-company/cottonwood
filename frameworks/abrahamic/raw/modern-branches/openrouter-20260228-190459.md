### **Modern Ethical Developments in Abrahamic Traditions (1800–Present)**  

The Abrahamic traditions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—have undergone profound ethical transformations in the modern era, responding to industrialization, colonialism, human rights movements, and ecological crises. These developments are not monolithic; they involve fierce internal debates, reformulations of classical ethics, and new syntheses with secular philosophies. Below is an analysis of key movements and tensions.

The ethical frameworks remain alive precisely because they are unresolved.

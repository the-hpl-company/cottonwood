### 1. **The Code of Hammurabi (~1754 BCE) — Ethical Shifts from Ur-Nammu**  
The **Code of Hammurabi** (CH) inherits from the earlier **Code of Ur-Nammu** (Ur-Nammu, ~2100 BCE) but introduces significant ethical transformations. In **Ur-Nammu**, the emphasis is on *restitution* — compensating harm monetarily rather than inflicting equivalent physical harm. For example, Ur-Nammu §1 mandates compensation for bodily injury: "If a man…cuts off another’s foot, he shall pay ten shekels of silver" (trans. Roth). By contrast, Hammurabi shifts to *lex talionis* ("an eye for an eye"), seen in CH §196: "If a man destroys the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye." This shift reflects a move from economic resolution to *retributive justice*, emphasizing proportional punishment over compensatory ethics.  

The class-based justice system in Hammurabi (*awilum*, *mushkenum*, *wardum*) introduces ethical hierarchies absent in Ur-Nammu. For example, CH §202 states: "If a man strikes the cheek of a man who is his superior, he shall be whipped sixty times with an ox-whip." This stratification codifies *unequal treatment based on social status*, contrasting sharply with Ur-Nammu's relative egalitarianism.  

### 2. **The Epic of Gilgamesh — Mortality and Ethical Transformation**  
The **Epic of Gilgamesh** (Standard Babylonian version, Tablet XI, ~13th c. BCE) profoundly reshapes Sumerian traditions. Gilgamesh's journey from a *tyrant* (Tablet I) to a *wisdom-seeker* (Tablet XI) embodies ethical transformation through confrontation with mortality. Enkidu's death (Tablet VII) catalyzes this shift, forcing Gilgamesh to grapple with the inevitability of death: "Must I die too? Must Gilgamesh be like that?"  

The flood narrative featuring Utnapishtim (Tablet XI) directly parallels Noah's story (Genesis 6–9). Utnapishtim’s account includes divine warning, ark-building, and animal preservation, but diverges in its polytheistic context and emphasis on *arbitrary divine will* rather than covenant ethics. The Babylonian text encapsulates a *fatalistic* worldview: "When the gods created mankind, death for mankind they set aside, life in their own hands retaining" (Tablet X, trans. George). This contrasts with Genesis’s covenantal theology.  

### 3. **Enuma Elish — Authority and Creation Ethics**  
The **Enuma Elish** (Babylonian creation epic, ~12th c. BCE) revises earlier Sumerian cosmogonies by elevating **Marduk** as the supreme deity. In the Sumerian tradition (e.g., *Enki and Ninmah*), creation is a collaborative effort among gods. By contrast, the **Enuma Elish** (Tablet IV) portrays Marduk as a *warrior king* who creates the cosmos through violence: "He split her like a shellfish into two parts."  

This reshapes the ethics of authority, emphasizing *divine might over divine benevolence*. Marduk’s ascendancy mirrors Babylonian kingship ideology, legitimizing *hierarchical power structures*.  

### 4. **Babylonian Theodicy — Righteous Suffering**  
The **Babylonian Theodicy** (BM 78267, ~11th c. BCE) and **Ludlul bel nemeqi** ("I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom," BM 62142, ~13th c. BCE) grapple with the problem of *righteous suffering*. Both texts echo themes later found in Job. In **Ludlul**, the sufferer laments: "I am wise, but why is my understanding darkened?" (II.10), paralleling Job's "Why do the wicked live on?" (Job 21:7).  

However, Babylonian theology lacks the covenantal framework of Job. The Babylonian texts ultimately affirm *divine inscrutability*, as seen in **The Theodicy**: "The pious man behaves wickedly, the wicked man behaves piously…who can comprehend the way of the gods?" (III.15–16). This contrasts with Job’s assertion of divine justice (Job 42:7).  

### 5. **Transmission Mechanisms — Babylonian Captivity**  
The **Babylonian Captivity** (586–539 BCE) served as the critical contact point for Israelite absorption of Mesopotamian traditions. Texts like the **Epic of Gilgamesh** and **Enuma Elish** were transmitted through *cultural contact*, likely shared orally or via cuneiform tablets. Stephanie Dalley (*Myths from Mesopotamia*) argues that Israelite scribes reworked these narratives into monotheistic frameworks, as seen in Genesis.  

### 6. **Textual Parallels**  
- **Flood Narratives**: Utnapishtim’s flood (Gilgamesh Tablet XI) parallels Noah’s flood (Genesis 6–9), with shared elements: divine warning, ark-building, and animal preservation.  
- **Creation Accounts**: **Enuma Elish** (Tablet IV) contrasts with Genesis 1–2; the Babylonian text emphasizes *divine conflict*, while Genesis focuses on *divine order*.  
- **Legal Codes**: Hammurabi’s *lex talionis* (CH §196) parallels Exodus 21:24, but Israelite law adds covenantal context.  

### 7. **Key Scholars and Contested Interpretations**  
- **Stephanie Dalley**: Emphasizes Mesopotamian influence on Biblical texts, particularly flood and creation narratives.  
- **Andrew George**: Authoritative translator of Gilgamesh; highlights the epic’s exploration of mortality.  
- **W.G. Lambert**: Analyzed Babylonian theodicy, noting its similarities to Job.  
- **Jean Bottéro**: Explored Mesopotamian religion’s ethical dimensions, particularly its fatalistic worldview.  

Controversies persist regarding the extent of Mesopotamian influence on Biblical thought. Some scholars (e.g., Lambert) argue for direct borrowing, while others (e.g., Bottéro) emphasize Israelite theological transformation of inherited material.  

In summary, Babylonian ethics inherits Sumerian foundations but reshapes them through *retributive justice*, *hierarchical authority*, and *fatalistic theodicy*. These transformations profoundly influenced later Abrahamic thought during the Babylonian Captivity, creating ethical tensions between Mesopotamian fatalism and Israelite covenantal theology.

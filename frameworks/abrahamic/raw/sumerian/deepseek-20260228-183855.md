# Sumerian Ethical Frameworks: The Mesopotamian Substrate of Abrahamic Traditions

## 1. **Enuma Elish: Cosmology of Divine Violence**
**Tablet IV, lines 129-146** (Marduk splits Tiamat): "He split her into two like a dried fish: One half of her he set up and stretched out as the heavens." This cosmogony establishes several ethical paradigms:

- **Power legitimizes creation**: Order (*kittu*) emerges from violent imposition (*ṭēmtu*). The younger gods' rebellion against Tiamat's chaos justifies Marduk's patricide/matricide.
- **Hierarchy as cosmic principle**: Marduk's victory establishes the divine assembly's authority structure, mirrored in human kingship (the *ensi* as Marduk's earthly regent).
- **Harm as creative act**: Tiamat's dismemberment becomes world-building. This differs fundamentally from *creatio ex nihilo* traditions—here, harm is ontologically prior to order.

**Ethical implication**: In this framework, justice (*mīšaru*) means maintaining the imposed order against chaos. Protection of the weak becomes not inherent right but duty of the strong to prevent system collapse. The *Epic of Creation* (K.5419c + Rm.618, etc.) presents this as normative: might establishes right.

## 2. **Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100-2050 BCE)**
**Oldest extant law code** (Ur-Nammu A 3077 tablet, Istanbul Museum):

- **Restitution principle**: "If a man commits a murder, that man must be killed" (§1, Ur-Nammu prologue). But note: "If a man cuts off the foot of another man, he shall weigh out 10 shekels of silver" (§18). Physical harm requires monetary compensation, not *lex talionis*.
- **Protection clauses**: "The orphan was not delivered up to the rich man; the widow was not delivered up to the mighty man" (prologue). This establishes state responsibility for vulnerable classes.
- **Class distinctions**: Penalties vary by social status. Harm against slaves (§4-5) draws lighter fines than against free persons.
- **False accusation penalties**: "If a man accused the wife of a young man of promiscuity but she is not caught sleeping with another man, she shall take an oath of innocence and return to her house" (§12). Perjurers face fines.

**Ethical framework**: Justice as restoration of balance through measured response. The code assumes hierarchical society but imposes ruler's obligation to prevent exploitation.

## 3. **ME: Divine Decrees of Civilization**
The **me** (Akkadian *parṣu*) are 100+ divine decrees establishing civilization's components. Key ethical **me** from "Inana and Enki" (ETCSL 1.3.1):

- **Truth** (*nì-ĝeš-ĝá*)
- **Falsehood** (*nì-ul*)
- **Justice** (*ní-si-sá*)
- **Merciful judgment** (*a-rá-zu dug₄-ga*)
- **Decision-making** (*ad-gi₄-gi₄*)
- **Protection of the weak** (implied in *ní-si-sá*)

**Conceptual framework**: Civilization isn't human invention but divine endowment. Ethics are embedded in cosmic structure. The **me** transfer from Eridu to Uruk (in the myth) establishes temple cities as ethical centers.

## 4. **Wisdom Literature: Practical Ethics**
**Instructions of Shuruppak** (c. 2600 BCE, ETCSL 5.6.1):
- "Do not buy a donkey that brays; it will split your yoke" (l. 52)—pragmatic wisdom.
- "Do not laugh with a girl if you are married; the slander is strong" (l. 148)—social consequence awareness.
- "You should not play around with a married young woman: the slander could be serious" (l. 149)—emphasis on reputation.

**Sumerian Proverbs** (UM 29-13-423):
- "A people without a king is like sheep without a shepherd" (SP 1.15)—authority as necessary.
- "The poor man is better dead than alive; if he has bread, he has no salt" (SP 2.25)—acute social observation.

**Farmer's Instructions** (Ninurta's Almanac, UET 6/2 414):
- Agricultural ethics: "After the field has been supplied with water, you should wet it only where it is dry" (l. 45)—stewardship principle.
- "Let your eye be on the man who puts in the barley seed" (l. 60)—personal responsibility.

**Emerging framework**: Ethics as practical wisdom for social stability, emphasizing consequence-aversion, reputation management, and stewardship.

## 5. **The Problem of Suffering**
**"A Man and His God"** (Ur III period, ETCSL 5.2.4):
- "I am a man, a discerning one, yet I cannot distinguish good from bad" (l. 12)—parallel to Job's confusion.
- Resolution: "His god accepted his tears and lamentation... turned the man's suffering into joy" (ll. 45-47).
- **Key difference from Job**: No cosmic challenge, only personal restoration through proper lament ritual.

**"Ludlul bēl nēmeqi"** ("I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom," later Babylonian but Sumerian-influenced):
- Suffering as possibly arbitrary: "What seems good to one's self could be an offense to a god" (Tablet II).
- **Ethical implication**: Piety doesn't guarantee protection. Right action maintains cosmic order but doesn't control divine will.

## 6. **Ur in Abraham's Period (c. 2000-1800 BCE)**
**Archaeological context** (Woolley's excavations, Ur III/Larsa periods):
- **Temple economy**: The E-temen-niguru ziggurat complex dominated city life. Abraham's family likely participated in moon-god Nanna/Sin cult (the city's patron).
- **Legal environment**: Ur-Nammu's code would have been known, though possibly superseded by Lipit-Ishtar's laws (c. 1930 BCE).
- **Ethical substrate Abraham carried**:
  1. **Covenant structure**: Temple oath-formulas (*riksu*) with conditional blessings/curses.
  2. **Sacrificial system**: *Kispum* rituals for ancestors.
  3. **Hospitality ethics**: Strong in Sumerian texts (e.g., Gilgamesh and Enkidu's bond).
  4. **Divine-human mediation**: King as shepherd (*sipa*) of people—later transformed into Abraham as covenant mediator.

**Specific Ur III texts from Abraham's era**: Administrative tablets show temple widows (*nu-gig*) receiving rations—institutionalized protection of vulnerable women.

## 7. **Key Scholars and Contested Interpretations**

**Primary Text Editions**:
- **Thorkild Jacobsen**: *The Treasures of Darkness* (1976) argued for "diminishing anthropomorphism" in Mesopotamian religion—contested by W.G. Lambert.
- **Samuel Noah Kramer**: *History Begins at Sumer* (1956) first systematized Sumerian ethical concepts but sometimes over-harmonized.
- **Jean Bottéro**: *Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia* (2001) emphasized the "divine decree" (*me*) system's centrality.
- **W.G. Lambert**: *Babylonian Wisdom Literature* (1960) established critical editions of key texts.

**Contested Issues**:
1. **Dating of "Sumerian Job"**: Claus Wilcke argues "A Man and His God" is Ur III (2100-2000 BCE), while some place it Old Babylonian (1800-1600).
2. **Ur-Nammu vs. Hammurabi**: Martha Roth shows Hammurabi's code is more retributive; Ur-Nammu's emphasis on restitution may reflect earlier Sumerian vs. Amorite approaches.
3. **ME interpretation**: Piotr Michalowski vs. Åke W. Sjöberg debate whether **me** are physical objects or abstract concepts.
4. **Abraham's Ur**: Traditional identification with Ur (Tell al-Muqayyar) challenged by Cyrus Gordon's "Ur of the Chaldees" as Urfa/Ḫarrān region—affects what cultural substrate we attribute.

**Transmission Mechanisms to Abrahamic Traditions**:
- **Direct textual**: Flood narrative (Eridu Genesis) → Atrahasis → Gilgamesh → Genesis 6-9.
- **Legal**: Restitution principles in Ur-Nammu → Exodus 21-23 (but with democratization).
- **Conceptual**: Cosmic battle (Enuma Elish) → Leviathan/Rahab imagery (Psalm 74:14, Isaiah 27:1).
- **Ethical tension**: Mesopotamian "suffering as possibly arbitrary" vs. developing Israelite "suffering as pedagogic" (Deuteronomy) or "covenantal testing" (Job).

**Critical Break**: The Abrahamic transformation occurs in **monotheizing the ethical source**. Where Sumerian ethics derive from multiple divine decrees (**me**) maintained by temple and king, Abrahamic tradition centers on **one divine will** revealed to a people. This enables the prophetic critique of power (Amos 5:24's "let justice roll down") impossible when king is god's regent.

This Sumerian substrate establishes the foundational questions—**cosmic order through violence, law as royal gift, suffering as divine mystery**—that the Abrahamic traditions will reinterpret, challenge, and transform across three millennia.

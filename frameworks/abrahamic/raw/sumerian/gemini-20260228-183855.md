Okay, here's an analysis of the ethical frameworks within Sumerian civilization, focusing on the elements that establish a foundation for later Abrahamic ethical developments.

**1. Enuma Elish: Creation Through Violence**

The *Enuma Elish* ("When on High"), a Babylonian creation myth (though drawing on earlier Sumerian sources), presents a cosmology born from divine conflict. Marduk, the patron deity of Babylon, defeats Tiamat, the primordial goddess of the sea, and fashions the cosmos from her dismembered body.

*   **Ethical Implications of Divine Combat:** The creation through violence has several ethical implications:

    *   **Power and Order:** It establishes a worldview where power is inherently linked to the imposition of order. Marduk's victory demonstrates that a more powerful, organized force can overcome chaos. This might implicitly justify hierarchical social structures and the use of force to maintain stability.
    *   **Harm as Intrinsic to Creation:** The very act of creation involves the dismemberment of Tiamat, suggesting that harm, even on a cosmic scale, is an intrinsic part of bringing order into existence. This is a profoundly different concept from later Abrahamic views of a creation born from divine speech and intention.
    *   **Legitimacy of Divine Authority:** Marduk's victory validates his authority. His actions, even the violent ones, are legitimized by their outcome—the creation of the world. This establishes a pattern where success can justify the means.
*   **Scholarly Interpretations:** Scholars like Thorkild Jacobsen have explored the *Enuma Elish* in terms of the transfer of power from older, less defined forces (Tiamat) to a more centralized, anthropomorphic god (Marduk). Jacobsen argues that the myth reflects the rise of centralized political power in Mesopotamia.
*   **Tablet References:** The *Enuma Elish* is primarily found on cuneiform tablets from the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (7th century BCE), though fragments and allusions appear earlier. It is typically referenced by tablet and line number (e.g., *Enuma Elish*, Tablet IV, line 130).

**2. The Code of Ur-Nammu: Justice and Restitution**

The Code of Ur-Nammu, predating the Code of Hammurabi by approximately three centuries, is one of the oldest known law codes.

*   **Ethical Principles:**

    *   **Restitution:** A central principle is the idea of monetary compensation for harm done. Fines are prescribed for various offenses, from bodily injury to property damage. This reflects a concern for restoring balance and repairing the social fabric.
    *   **Lex Talionis (Limited):** While some believe it exists in earlier forms in this code, *lex talionis* ("eye for an eye") is largely absent in the Code of Ur-Nammu. Compensation is preferred over direct retaliation.
    *   **Protection of the Vulnerable:** The code explicitly addresses the protection of widows and orphans, outlining specific provisions to ensure their well-being. This highlights a societal recognition of the need to care for those who are most susceptible to exploitation.
*   **Handling of Harm:** The Code meticulously details the penalties for different types of harm. For example:

    *   "If a man cuts off the foot of another man with a [weapon], he shall pay 10 shekels of silver."
    *   "If a man knocks out a tooth of another man, he shall pay 2 shekels of silver."
*   **Scholarly Interpretations:** Martha Roth's work on Mesopotamian law emphasizes the practical and pragmatic nature of these codes, focusing on maintaining social order and resolving disputes. Samuel Kramer's work highlights the Code's importance as a reflection of Sumerian social values.
*   **Tablet References:** The Code of Ur-Nammu is known from fragments found in Nippur and Ur. Reconstructions are based on these fragments.

**3. The Concept of ME (Divine Decrees)**

The concept of *ME* (Sumerian: 𒈨, Akkadian: *parṣu*) represents the fundamental, immutable decrees and principles that govern civilization and the cosmos. They are divine in origin and essential for maintaining order and prosperity.

*   **Specific *ME* Related to Ethics:**

    *   ***Namtilla***: (Life) — The Me of Life sustained individuals and community.
    *   ***Ushum***: (Justice) — The Me of Justice governed right and wrong conduct, including retribution.
    *   ***Nig-Si-Sa***: (Righteousness) — Upright dealings between citizens.
    *   ***Ki-Ag2***: (Love) — The basis of familial and communal bonds.

*   **Treatment of the Powerless:** Some *ME* specifically address the treatment of the vulnerable. For example, there is a strong expectation that rulers should uphold justice and protect the weak from the strong. The *ME* related to governance emphasize the king's responsibility to ensure the well-being of his people.
*   **Scholarly Interpretations:** Jacobsen and Bottéro delve into the *ME* as essential components of Sumerian cosmology and social order. These scholars have emphasized how the *ME* were believed to be held by specific deities and how their proper maintenance was crucial for the stability of the world.

**4. Sumerian Wisdom Literature**

Sumerian wisdom literature provides insights into the everyday ethics and values of the society.

*   **Instructions of Shuruppak:** This text offers practical advice on a wide range of topics, from agriculture to social interactions. It emphasizes prudence, honesty, and respect for elders. For instance, "Do not buy a donkey that brays too much" (practical advice), and "Do not curse strongly; it rebounds on you" (moral advice).
*   **Sumerian Proverbs:** These short, pithy sayings offer glimpses into Sumerian attitudes toward work, family, and social life. Some proverbs promote hard work and diligence, while others caution against arrogance and deceit.
*   **Farmer's Almanac:** This text provides agricultural guidance, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and diligent labor. It highlights the connection between human actions and the success of crops, reinforcing the idea that ethical behavior (in this case, responsible farming) leads to positive outcomes.
*   **Ethical Framework:** A practical, pragmatic ethical framework emerges from these texts. The emphasis is on behavior that promotes individual success and social harmony. While not explicitly religious in the same way as later Abrahamic texts, these works embed ethical considerations within the context of daily life.
*   **Text Citations:** *Instructions of Shuruppak* is available in various translations, often referenced by line number. Sumerian proverbs can be found in collections like Bendt Alster's *Proverbs of Ancient Sumer*.

**5. The Problem of Suffering: "A Man and His God"**

Sumerian literature grapples with the problem of unjust suffering, much like the Book of Job in the Hebrew Bible.

*   **"A Man and His God":** This text presents a lament by a righteous man who has fallen on hard times. He questions why the gods have abandoned him despite his piety. While the text does not offer a definitive answer, it suggests that human understanding of divine will is limited and that even the righteous may suffer for reasons beyond their comprehension.
*   **Sumerian Perspective on Suffering:** Sumerian thought generally attributes suffering to the inscrutable will of the gods. There is a sense that humans are subject to forces beyond their control and that even virtuous behavior does not guarantee a life free from hardship.
*   **Scholarly Interpretations:** Thorkild Jacobsen analyzes "A Man and His God" as a reflection of the individual's struggle to reconcile personal experience with traditional religious beliefs. He argues that the text represents a step toward a more personal and emotional relationship with the divine.
*   **Text Citations:** "A Man and His God" is available in translation in collections of Sumerian literature.

**6. Ur: Abraham's City**

Ur was a major Sumerian city-state, a center of trade, culture, and religion.

*   **Ethical and Religious Environment:** During the period Abraham is traditionally believed to have lived (early 2nd millennium BCE), Ur was a complex society with a well-developed legal system, a pantheon of gods, and a rich literary tradition. The ethical environment would have been shaped by the principles outlined in the Code of Ur-Nammu, the teachings of Sumerian wisdom literature, and the prevailing religious beliefs.
*   **Cultural Substrate:** Abraham would have been exposed to the Sumerian concepts of justice, social responsibility, and the importance of maintaining order. The stories and myths of Sumerian religion, including the *Enuma Elish* and the Epic of Gilgamesh, would have formed part of his cultural background. He would have carried with him a worldview shaped by the Sumerian understanding of the cosmos and the relationship between humans and the divine.
*   **Contested Scholarship:** The historicity of Abraham and the details of his life are subjects of ongoing debate. While the Bible identifies Ur as his place of origin, the exact nature of his relationship to the city and its culture remains a matter of interpretation.

**7. Key Scholars and Contested Interpretations**

*   **Thorkild Jacobsen:** A leading scholar of Sumerian religion and culture, known for his work on the *Enuma Elish*, "A Man and His God," and the nature of Sumerian religious experience.
*   **Samuel Noah Kramer:** A prolific translator and interpreter of Sumerian texts, including the Code of Ur-Nammu.
*   **Martha Roth:** An expert on Mesopotamian law, providing valuable insights into the practical application of legal codes and their social context.
*   **Piotr Steinkeller:** Important work on Sumerian state formation and social structure.
*   **Miguel Civil:** Contributions to Sumerian lexicography and literature.

**Contested Interpretations:**

*   **Dating of Texts:** Precise dating of Sumerian texts is often challenging, leading to debates about the relative chronology of different works and their influence on one another.
*   **Interpretation of Religious Beliefs:** The nature of Sumerian religious beliefs is complex and open to interpretation. Scholars disagree on the degree to which Sumerians believed in a personal relationship with the gods and the extent to which their religious practices were driven by fear or devotion.
*   **Influence on Abrahamic Traditions:** While there is general agreement that Sumerian culture influenced the development of the Abrahamic traditions, the specific mechanisms of transmission and the extent of that influence are subjects of ongoing scholarly debate.

This analysis provides a foundation for understanding the ethical framework that existed in Sumerian civilization and its potential influence on the later development of the Abrahamic traditions. Future commits will explore how these themes are reinterpreted and transformed in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Quran.

### 1. **The Enuma Elish (Tablet IV-VI)**  
The *Enuma Elish* presents a cosmology of creation through divine violence, where Marduk slays Tiamat to form the heavens and earth. This myth encodes an ethical framework where *order emerges from chaos through domination*, shaping Mesopotamian notions of power and justice. The ethical implications are profound:  
- **Cosmic Order as Divine Violence**: Marduk’s establishment of order (e.g., Tablet VI, lines 1-10) legitimizes hierarchical authority and the use of force to maintain societal stability.  
- **Harm as Necessity**: Tiamat’s destruction is framed as necessary for creation, suggesting a utilitarian view of harm.  
- **Divine Power and Human Ethics**: Mesopotamian rulers, as earthly representatives of gods, could justify harsh measures as divinely sanctioned.  
(*Reference: Babylonian Creation Epic, Tablet IV-VI, ANET 60-72; Thorkild Jacobsen’s *The Treasures of Darkness*, 168-183*)

### 2. **The Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100-2050 BCE)**  
The Code of Ur-Nammu, one of the earliest legal codes, establishes principles of restitution and proportionality:  
- **Restitution over Retribution**: Crimes are addressed through compensation (e.g., "If a man knocks out the eye of another man, he shall weigh out 60 shekels of silver" [§§18-19]).  
- **Protection of the Vulnerable**: Widows and orphans are explicitly protected (e.g., "If a widow is left without support, the king shall provide for her" [§25]).  
- **Hierarchical Justice**: Penalties vary by social class, reflecting societal stratification.  
(*Reference: Ur-Nammu Law Code §§ 1-32; Martha Roth, *Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor*, 13-22*)

### 3. **The ME (Divine Decrees)**  
The ME, or divine decrees, represent the foundational principles of Sumerian civilization:  
- **Justice and Truth**: The ME include principles like *nam-tar* (destiny) and *nam-nita* (truth), which govern societal order.  
- **Mercy and Care**: Decrees related to *nam-lugal* (kingship) emphasize the king’s duty to protect the weak.  
- **Civilizational Order**: The ME encode the ethical responsibilities of rulers and priests to maintain harmony.  
(*Reference: *Inana and Enki* tablet, ETCSL 1.3.1; Samuel Noah Kramer, *The Sumerians*, 115-130*)

### 4. **Sumerian Wisdom Literature**  
- **Instructions of Shuruppak** (c. 2500 BCE): Practical ethics emphasizing humility, honesty, and care for others (e.g., "Do not commit violence, do not cause hardship" [ETCSL 5.6.1]).  
- **Sumerian Proverbs**: Reflect communal values (e.g., "A kind word builds confidence" [ETCSL 6.1.30]).  
- **Farmer’s Almanac**: Ethical stewardship of land and resources is emphasized.  
(*Reference: ETCSL 5.6.1 and 6.1.30; Bendt Alster, *Wisdom of Ancient Sumer*, 45-67*)

### 5. **The Problem of Suffering**  
Texts like *"A Man and His God"* (ETCSL 5.6.1) grapple with unjust suffering:  
- **Divine Capriciousness**: Suffering is often attributed to divine will, but humans are urged to seek reconciliation through piety.  
- **Piety as Response**: The sufferer seeks redress through prayer and ritual, emphasizing humility and submission.  
(*Reference: ETCSL 5.6.1; Jean Bottéro, *Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia*, 201-215*)

### 6. **Ur in Abraham’s Time (c. 2000-1800 BCE)**  
Ur was a thriving Sumerian city with a sophisticated ethical-religious framework:  
- **Ethical Context**: Abraham emerges from a culture steeped in Sumerian legal and moral traditions.  
- **Religious Substrate**: The worship of Nanna (moon god) and Enlil (chief deity) shaped communal ethics.  
- **Cultural Legacy**: Abraham’s departure likely carried Sumerian concepts of justice, stewardship, and divine order.  
(*Reference: Leonard Woolley, *Ur of the Chaldees*, 79-94; Marc Van De Mieroop, *A History of the Ancient Near East*, 67-89*)

### 7. **Key Scholars and Contested Interpretations**  
- **Thorkild Jacobsen**: Interprets Mesopotamian myth as reflecting societal values (*The Treasures of Darkness*).  
- **Samuel Noah Kramer**: Emphasizes the ethical dimensions of Sumerian literature (*The Sumerians*).  
- **Martha Roth**: Provides critical editions of legal texts (*Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor*).  
- **Jean Bottéro**: Explores Mesopotamian religion and ethics (*Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia*).  
Contests persist over the dating of texts like the Instructions of Shuruppak and the extent of Sumerian influence on later traditions.  

This Sumerian ethical substrate—hierarchical yet protective, violent yet ordered—forms the foundation upon which Abrahamic traditions build, react, and transform.

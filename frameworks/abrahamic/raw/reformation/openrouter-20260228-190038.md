The Reformation (1517–1648) was not merely a theological dispute but an ethical revolution that transformed Christianity and the West. It represented a crisis in moral reasoning, with profound implications for Jewish-Christian-Muslim relations, political ethics, and the nature of religious authority. Below is an analysis structured around your key points:

---

### 1. **Martin Luther: Sola Fide, Two Kingdoms, and the Peasants' War**
Luther's doctrine of *sola fide* (faith alone, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16) challenged the sacramental ethics of Catholicism. If salvation is by faith, ethical behavior becomes a response to grace, not a means to earn it (*Romans 6:1-2*). In his *Two Kingdoms Doctrine* (*On Secular Authority*, 1523), Luther distinguished between the spiritual kingdom (governed by grace) and the earthly kingdom (governed by law). This dualism allowed Luther to justify the harsh suppression of the Peasants' War (1524–1525). Despite the peasants citing Luther's theology (*The Twelve Articles of the Peasants*), he sided with princes in his tract *Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants* (1525), arguing that rebellion against authority violates Romans 13:1-7. This marked a failure to reconcile his theology with social justice, exposing a tension between spiritual freedom and earthly order.

### 2. **John Calvin: Election, Work Ethic, and Resistance**
Calvin's doctrine of election (*Institutes of the Christian Religion*, III.21–24) emphasized predestination, raising the ethical question: If salvation is predetermined, why act virtuously? Calvin answered that good works testify to one's election (James 2:18). Max Weber later argued that this fostered the Protestant work ethic (*The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, 1905), though scholars debate this thesis. Geneva under Calvin became a theocratic experiment, enforcing strict moral codes (e.g., punishments for adultery, blasphemy). Calvinist resistance theory, developed by Theodore Beza (*On the Right of Magistrates*, 1574) and John Knox (*The First Blast of the Trumpet*, 1558), justified resistance to ungodly rulers, influencing later Monarchomachs and the English Civil War.

### 3. **The Radical Reformation: Anabaptists and the Schleitheim Confession**
The Radical Reformation, embodied by the Anabaptists, rejected both Catholic and Magisterial Reformation ethics. Their *Schleitheim Confession* (1527) articulated pacifism (Matthew 5:39), separation from the state (John 18:36), and community of goods (Acts 2:44-45). Menno Simons, a key leader, emphasized nonviolence and discipleship (*The Foundation of Christian Doctrine*, 1539–40). However, the Münster Rebellion (1534–1535), led by radical Anabaptists, devolved into apocalyptic violence, showcasing the dangers of millenarian ethics. Today, the Amish and Hutterites maintain Anabaptist ethical commitments, emphasizing simplicity and nonresistance.

### 4. **The Quaker Tradition: Inner Light and Equality**
George Fox founded the Quaker movement, emphasizing the *Inner Light* (John 1:9) as the basis for ethical discernment. Quakers rejected formal creeds, relying instead on direct spiritual experience. Their peace testimony (Matthew 5:9) and testimony of equality (Galatians 3:28) led to practices like plain speech and refusal to doff hats. Quaker ethics drove abolitionism (John Woolman's *Journal*), prison reform (Elizabeth Fry), and mental health reform (The Retreat, York). The belief in "that of God in everyone" underpinned their universalist ethics.

### 5. **The English Revolution: Levellers and Diggers**
The English Civil War (1642–1651) brought radical ethical questions to the fore. The Levellers, represented by Colonel Thomas Rainsborough at the Putney Debates (1647), argued for political equality: "The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live, as the greatest he." The Diggers, led by Gerrard Winstanley (*The True Levellers' Standard Advanced*, 1649), advocated communal ownership of land, citing Acts 4:32. These movements challenged aristocratic privilege and laid the groundwork for modern democratic ethics.

### 6. **The Wars of Religion: Thirty Years' War and Westphalia**
The Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) exemplified the ethical catastrophe of religious conflict. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) established the principle of *cuius regio, eius religio* (whose realm, his religion), creating the modern state system. Religious tolerance emerged as a pragmatic solution rather than a moral principle, marking a shift from theological to political ethics.

### 7. **The Counter-Reformation: Trent and Jesuit Casuistry**
The Catholic Counter-Reformation responded to Protestant ethics with the Council of Trent (1545–1563), reaffirming the necessity of good works (James 2:24) and the authority of tradition. Jesuit casuistry, exemplified by Blaise Pascal's critique (*Provincial Letters*, 1656–1657), used case-based reasoning to navigate ethical dilemmas. Ignatius of Loyola's *Spiritual Exercises* (1548) provided a framework for moral formation. Jesuit missions, such as those in China and the Americas, faced ethical complexities in reconciling Catholic teaching with indigenous cultures.

### Conclusion
The Reformation was fundamentally an ethical crisis, forcing Christians to reevaluate the relationship between faith, works, and society. Its legacy includes tensions between spiritual freedom and social order, the rise of democratic ethics, and the pragmatic origins of religious tolerance. These developments reverberated across Jewish-Christian-Muslim relations, shaping the modern world.

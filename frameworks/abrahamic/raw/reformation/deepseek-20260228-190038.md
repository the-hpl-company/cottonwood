# The Reformation as Ethical Revolution (1500–1700)

## 1. Luther: Sola Fide and the Two Kingdoms – An Ethical Fracture
**Sola Fide (Faith Alone):** Luther’s doctrine, articulated in *The Freedom of a Christian* (1520), posits that “the soul is justified by faith alone, and not by any works” (Luther, 1520, WA 7:49). Ethical implication: Good works flow *from* faith, not *toward* salvation. “Good works do not make a good man, but a good man does good works” (ibid.). Motivation becomes gratitude, not merit.

**Two Kingdoms Doctrine:** In *Temporal Authority: To What Extent It Should Be Obeyed* (1523, WA 11:245–281), Luther distinguishes God’s spiritual kingdom (governed by Gospel, grace) from the earthly kingdom (governed by law, coercion). Ethical dualism emerges: Christians obey secular rulers (Romans 13:1) while living by higher spiritual ethics personally.

**The Peasants’ War (1524–25):** Peasants cite Luther’s theology in the *Twelve Articles of the Swabian Peasants* (Article 3: “Christ has redeemed us all… with his precious blood… the gospel does not make us free in body and property?”). Luther’s response in *Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants* (1525, WA 18:357–361): urges princes to “stab, smite, slay” rebels, arguing they confuse the two kingdoms. Ethical failure: Luther privileges social order over distributive justice, exposing a tension between spiritual equality and earthly hierarchy. Scholar **Steven Ozment** notes: “Luther’s ethical vision collapsed when faced with social revolution” (*The Age of Reform*, 1980).

## 2. Calvin: Election, Work Ethic, and Resistance
**Doctrine of Election:** In *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (1559), Calvin argues predestination is “God’s eternal decree” (3.21.5). Ethical implication: Assurance of election manifests in disciplined, sanctified life. “We are justified not without works, yet not by works” (3.16.1). Weber’s *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* (1905) controversially links Calvinist “inner-worldly asceticism” to capitalist accumulation, though scholars like **Diarmaid MacCulloch** caution against overstatement (*Reformation: A History*, 2003).

**Geneva as Ethical Experiment:** Calvin’s *Ecclesiastical Ordinances* (1541) create a consistory enforcing moral discipline (dress, speech, commerce). Ethical tension: communal holiness vs. coercive control.

**Calvinist Resistance Theory:** Developed by **Theodore Beza** (*Right of Magistrates*, 1574), **John Knox** (*First Blast of the Trumpet*, 1558), and the Monarchomachs (*Vindiciae contra Tyrannos*, 1579). Ethical shift: lower magistrates may resist tyrannical rulers, grounding in covenant theology (2 Kings 11:17). This breaks with Luther’s passive obedience, justifying later revolutions.

## 3. The Radical Reformation: Anabaptist Ethics of Separation
**Schleitheim Confession (1527):** Seven articles establish ethical distinctives: believer’s baptism (Article 1), ban (Article 2), Lord’s Supper (Article 3), separation from “evil” (Article 4), pacifism (Article 6: “the sword is an ordering of God outside the perfection of Christ”), refusal of oaths (Article 7). Ethical core: discipleship as costly imitation of Christ.

**Community of Goods:** Hutterites, following Jacob Hutter, practice Acts 2:44–45. **Menno Simons** (*Foundation of Christian Doctrine*, 1539) emphasizes nonviolence and communal accountability. Living ethical communities: Amish (Jakob Ammann) and Hutterites maintain these ethics today.

**The Münster Rebellion (1534–35):** Apocalyptic, violent takeover by Melchiorites under Jan van Leiden. Ethical warning: radical eschatology can invert pacifist ethics into tyranny. **Brad Gregory** cites Münster as a “trauma that shaped Anabaptist memory” (*Salvation at Stake*, 1999).

## 4. Quaker Tradition: The Inner Light as Ethical Guide
**George Fox** experiences “openings” (1640s). The Inner Light— “that of God in everyone” (Journal, 1694)—becomes ethical foundation. Ethical testimonies:
- **Peace Testimony:** 1660 declaration to Charles II: “We utterly deny all outward wars and strife.”
- **Equality Testimony:** Reject hat-honor, titles, plain speech (using “thee/thou”).
- **Social Reform:** Quakers lead abolition (John Woolman’s *Journal*, 1754), prison reform (Elizabeth Fry), mental health care (York Retreat).

Ethical implication: If God is within all, then oppression is blasphemy.

## 5. The English Revolution: Puritanism and Popular Ethics
**Puritans:** Seek to “purify” Church of England. **Oliver Cromwell’s** New Model Army includes lay preachers debating ethics.

**The Putney Debates (1647):** Recorded in *Clarke Papers*. Colonel **Thomas Rainsborough** argues for male suffrage: “The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live, as the greatest he” (October 29, 1647). Ethical reasoning: natural rights grounded in creation, not property.

**Levellers** (John Lilburne) advocate popular sovereignty; **Diggers** (Gerrard Winstanley) declare common ownership in *The True Levellers’ Standard Advanced* (1649): “The earth was made a common treasury for all.” Ethical vision: Protestant individualism merges with communitarian equality.

## 6. Wars of Religion: From Catastrophe to Compromise
**Thirty Years’ War (1618–48):** Ethical catastrophe—atrocities like the Sack of Magdeburg (1631) kill 20,000. Confessionalization (**Heinz Schilling**) turns theology into territorial politics.

**Peace of Westphalia (1648):** *Cuius regio, eius religio* extended to Calvinism. Ethical compromise: sovereignty trumps religious truth. Tolerance emerges from exhaustion, not principle. **MacCulloch** notes: “Westphalia did not endorse religious freedom; it legitimized state control of religion” (*Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years*, 2009).

## 7. Counter-Reformation: Jesuit Casuistry and Mission Ethics
**Council of Trent (1545–63):** Reaffirms sacramental theology, condemns justification by faith alone (Session 6, Canon 9). Ethical formation emphasized through confession and catechesis.

**Ignatius of Loyola’s *Spiritual Exercises* (1548):** Method of discernment— “to seek and find the will of God” (Annotation 1). Ethical aim: mold will to God’s service.

**Jesuit Casuistry:** Case-based reasoning in manuals like **Juan de Lugo’s** *De Iustitia et Iure* (1642). Ethical complexity: balancing divine law with human circumstances, later satirized as laxism in Pascal’s *Provincial Letters* (1656).

**Jesuit Missions:** **Matteo Ricci** in China adapts to Confucian rites (accommodatio), raising ethical questions about syncretism vs. evangelism.

## 8. Parallel Developments in Judaism and Islam
**Judaism:** Post-1492 Sephardic diaspora leads to ethical synthesis in **Joseph Karo’s** *Shulchan Aruch* (1563). Lurianic Kabbalah (Isaac Luria) responds to trauma with ethical cosmology: *tikkun olam* (repair of the world). **Sabbatean movement** (1660s) mirrors radical Reformation enthusiasm—ethical antinomianism under Sabbatai Zevi.

**Islam:** No direct Reformation, but parallels: **Sufi renewals** (Mughal India’s Naqshbandiyya) emphasize inner piety. **Ottoman legal codifications** (kanunnames) balance sharia with state law, akin to Westphalian sovereignty. **Ahmad Sirhindi’s** (1564–1624) reform attempts mirror Catholic renewal.

## Conclusion: The Reformation as Ethical Crisis
The Reformation was fundamentally an ethical revolution. **Brad Gregory** argues it “fragmented the medieval sacramental community into competing moral regimes” (*The Unintended Reformation*, 2012). Key ethical shifts:
1. **Authority:** From church hierarchy to individual conscience (Luther) or community (Anabaptists).
2. **Motivation:** From merit to gratitude (Luther) or evidence of election (Calvin).
3. **Political Ethics:** From unified Christendom to territorial sovereignty (Westphalia) or resistance theory (Calvinists).
4. **Social Ethics:** From corporal works of mercy to systemic reform (Quakers, Puritans).

The ethical legacy is not unity but pluralism—competing visions of the good life that define modernity’s moral landscape.

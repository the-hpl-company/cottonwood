### The Marxian Framework: Harm, Care, and Vulnerability as Functions of Capital

Karl Marx’s philosophical system constitutes a radical critique of the social relations of production under capitalism, redefining concepts of harm, care, and protection not as moral absolutes but as historical phenomena rooted in material conditions. His work argues that capitalism is not merely an economic system with inequitable outcomes but a social order that systematically inflicts a multi-dimensional harm on human existence, dismantling traditional structures of care while rendering new populations profoundly vulnerable. This survey traces the development of this critique from his early humanist writings to his mature economic analysis.

#### **Alienation (Entfremdung) as Structural Harm: The *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844***

In the *Ökonomisch-philosophische Manuskripte*, Marx diagnoses the fundamental harm of capitalism as alienation, a condition where the worker’s own activity becomes an alien, hostile force. This harm unfolds in four interconnected dimensions.

First, the worker is alienated from the *product of labor*. The object produced “confronts it as *something alien*, as a *power independent* of the producer.” The more the worker produces, the more they enrich a world of commodities that dominates them. Second, alienation occurs within the *act of production* itself. Labor becomes “external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being… he does not affirm himself but denies himself.” Work is reduced to a mere means for physical subsistence, not an expression of human capacity.

Third, and most profoundly, this process alienates humans from their *species-being (Gattungswesen)*. For Marx, the human essence is “free, conscious activity.” Unlike an animal, “man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness.” Capitalism reduces this creative, universal potential to fragmented, mindless labor for wages, harming the worker’s very nature. Finally, this results in alienation *from other humans*. If one’s own activity is an alienated misery, the other appears either as a competitor or as the capitalist—the alien master of one’s labor. The harm is thus ontological and social: a severing of the individual from their creative essence and from genuine community.

#### **Species-Being and the Harm of Reduction**

The concept of *Gattungswesen* is central to understanding the depth of Marxian harm. It posits that human fulfillment lies in conscious, collective, and creative world-making. Capitalism’s sin is its reduction of this multi-faceted being to a one-dimensional “labor-power,” a commodity to be bought and sold. The harm, therefore, transcends material deprivation (though it includes it). It is the spiritual and psychological damage of being prevented from realizing one’s distinctly human potentials. As Marx writes, the worker “only feels himself freely active in his animal functions—eating, drinking, procreating… and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal.” The system protects only the capacity for work, while exposing and eroding the capacity for a fully human life.

#### **The Materialist Basis of Morality and Care: *The German Ideology***

In *Die deutsche Ideologie*, written with Friedrich Engels, Marx historicizes concepts of care and morality. The materialist conception of history holds that “the production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men.” Morality, religion, and philosophy are not autonomous forces but part of the “superstructure” arising from the “real foundation” of the economic base.

This has a decisive implication for care: what a society valorizes as moral “care” is often an ideology that masks and sustains underlying power relations. Feudal notions of *noblesse oblige* or bourgeois ideals of charity function to legitimize class rule by presenting it as benevolent. The question of whether care is a “genuine moral impulse” is, for Marx, secondary to analyzing whose interests a given pattern of care serves. Genuine, universal care becomes possible only when the material conditions that necessitate care as a patchwork for systemic neglect—namely, class antagonism—are abolished.

#### **Commodity Fetishism and the Disguise of Social Relations: *Capital, Volume I***

In the famous chapter on commodity fetishism in *Das Kapital*, Marx explains how the market mystifies relationships of harm and dependency. In capitalism, the “social relation between men” assumes “the fantastic form of a relation between things.” The value of a commodity obscures the labor and social relations that produced it.

This fetishism has direct implications for care. When human relationships are mediated by the cash nexus, protection becomes a function of market value. Those whose labor-power can be profitably exploited (the employed proletariat) are “protected” only insofar as they remain productive. Those with no marketable labor-power (the unemployed, the ill, the very young and old) are exposed as “surplus” unless they can be sustained through privatized familial care or state intervention, which itself is conditioned by the need to maintain social stability for capital. Care becomes either a private commodity to be purchased or a calculated administrative function, not a direct social relation.

#### **Exploitation as Structural Harm: The Labor Theory of Value**

Marx’s labor theory of value is the mechanism by which he quantifies systemic harm. The worker’s labor-power creates more value (*Wert*) in a day than the value required to reproduce that labor-power (the wage). The difference—*surplus value*—is appropriated by the capitalist. This is not merely an unfair distribution but a continuous, structural act of extraction that is the engine of capital accumulation.

This analysis underpins Marx’s distinction between *formal* and *real* freedom. The worker is formally free to sell their labor to any capitalist, but is *really* unfree, compelled by the threat of starvation to enter into an exploitative relationship. The system thus legally protects the right to contract while structurally harming the worker through exploitation. The vulnerable population here is the entire working class, whose collective labor sustains a system that inherently dispossesses them.

#### **The Destruction of Pre-Capitalist Care: *The Communist Manifesto***

In the *Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei*, Marx and Engels famously declare that the bourgeoisie “has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations” and “has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous ‘cash payment.’” This is a crucial point regarding care: the revolutionary rise of capitalism actively dismantles the (often oppressive) pre-capitalist structures—the extended family, the guild, the manorial estate, the church—that had provided defined, if hierarchical, forms of protection and social belonging.

The harm of capitalism is thus twofold: it creates mass vulnerability by divorcing producers from the means of subsistence, and it simultaneously destroys the traditional social fabric that might have mitigated that vulnerability, replacing it with the impersonal logic of the market. The nuclear family is then burdened with the entire task of reproductive care, a pressure that Marxist-feminist theory would later scrutinize.

#### **The State as an Instrument of Class Rule**

For Marx, the state is “but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.” It is not a neutral arbiter capable of impartially administering care. State-administered welfare, public health, or education are always shaped by the imperative to maintain the stability of the capitalist system and reproduce a healthy, disciplined workforce. While reforms can mitigate the worst harms, they do not address their root cause in class antagonism. State care, therefore, is ultimately a form of managing systemic contradictions, not a realization of a universal duty to protect.

#### **Legacy and Expansion**

Marx’s framework has been extended to analyze forms of harm he underemphasized. The Frankfurt School (e.g., Horkheimer, Adorno) applied the critique of alienation and commodification to culture and psychology. Liberation theology appropriated Marx’s critique of oppression to analyze the “preferential option for the poor.” Feminist Marxists, most notably Silvia Federici, analyzed *reproductive labor*—the unpaid care, domestic work, and child-rearing primarily performed by women—as the invisible foundation that sustains the exploited wage-laborer, itself a site of gendered exploitation. Contemporary debates on AI and automation frame labor displacement as a new frontier of alienation, where human *Gattungswesen* is rendered obsolete by machinery, creating a “surplus” population without a clear role under capitalism.

#### **Critiques of the Marxian Framework**

Significant critiques challenge Marx’s paradigm. First, his utopianism: can a post-capitalist society truly eliminate harm, or is harm a permanent condition of social life to be managed? The totalitarian implementations of the 20th century, claiming Marxist lineage, demonstrated the perils of attempting to realize this vision through state terror. Second, and most substantively, critics argue that Marx’s framework, by reducing all social antagonism to class, is blind to other, intersecting forms of domination based on race, gender, sexuality, and disability. These critiques hold that harm is not monolithic but multi-axial, and that a theory focused solely on the exploitation of labor-power cannot fully account for the specific vulnerabilities produced by patriarchy or white supremacy.

**Conclusion**

Karl Marx’s philosophical framework presents a comprehensive theory of harm as endemic to the capitalist mode of production. Harm is alienation from one’s human essence; care is a social relation distorted by ideology and commodification; vulnerability is systematically produced by the requirements of capital accumulation. While subsequent thought has challenged and expanded its boundaries, Marx’s core insight remains foundational: to understand the logic of protection and neglect in modern society, one must first analyze the economic relations that structure human life itself.

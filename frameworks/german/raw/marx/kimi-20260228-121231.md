 **Marx and the Materialist Critique of Harm: From Alienation to Emancipation**

Within the library of Western moral philosophy, the German tradition from Kant through the Frankfurt School offers a distinctive approach to the problems of harm, care, and the protection of vulnerable populations. Where French phenomenological and structuralist traditions have emphasized the face-to-face encounter, the body, and the Symbolic order as the sites where vulnerability is registered, the German materialist tradition stemming from Karl Marx insists that the primary site of both harm and its potential remediation lies in the *mode of production* (*Produktionsweise*). For Marx, the question is not primarily how we ought to care for the vulnerable given existing social arrangements, but rather how the existing arrangements themselves produce vulnerability as a structural necessity. This essay surveys Marx's philosophical framework across his major works—the *Ökonomisch-philosophische Manuskripte* (Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844), *Die deutsche Ideologie* (The German Ideology), *Das Kapital* (Capital), and the *Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei* (Communist Manifesto)—to explicate his theory of harm as ontological deformation, his critique of care under commodity fetishism, and his ambivalent legacy for contemporary theories of protection and dependency.

### The Phenomenology of Harm: Alienation and the Degraded Subject

Marx’s early formulation of harm appears most vividly in the *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, where he appropriates and transforms Hegel’s concept of *Entfremdung* (alienation) to describe the specific injury inflicted by capitalist wage labor. Unlike Hegel, for whom alienation constitutes a necessary stage in the self-realization of Spirit, Marx treats alienation as a contingent historical catastrophe that systematically dismantles the human subject across four interconnected dimensions.

First, the worker is alienated from the product of labor (*Entfremdung vom Produkt*). Under capitalist property relations, the object that the worker creates confronts her as an alien power: "The object which labour produces—labour’s product—confronts it as something alien (*fremd*), as a power independent of the producer." This objectification becomes alienation because the product belongs not to the producer but to the capitalist; as accumulation proceeds, the worker becomes increasingly impoverished while the world of objects grows in hostile grandeur. Second, the worker experiences alienation from the process of labor itself (*Entfremdung vom Produktionsprozess*). Work under capitalism is not free creative activity but forced labor—"external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being." In the factory and the office, the laborer does not affirm but denies himself, feeling "at home" only in his animal functions (eating, sleeping, procreating) while estranged from his distinctly human capacities during the working day.

Third, and most philosophically significant, Marx identifies alienation from *Gattungswesen* (species-being or species-essence). Drawing upon but critiquing Feuerbach’s anthropology, Marx defines the human species-character as "free, conscious activity" (*freie, bewusste Tätigkeit*). While an animal produces only what it immediately needs, destroying what it cannot use, the human being "produces universally" and "also forms objects in accordance with the laws of beauty." When labor is reduced to a mere means of survival, the worker is "confined to a divergent, one-sided, and dependent development," stripped of the capacity for "rich, many-sided, and universal" development that constitutes genuine human flourishing. The harm here exceeds material deprivation; it is an ontological injury that reduces the human to the animalistic, confining existence to "life-activity" rather than "species-life."

Finally, these three alienations culminate in the fourth: alienation from other human beings (*Entfremdung vom Menschen*). As the product belongs to the capitalist, the worker stands in a relation of estrangement to the owner of capital, to competing fellow workers, and to the potential community of freely associated producers. The vulnerability of the worker is thus not merely individual misfortune but a relational condition: "Every self-estrangement (*Selbstentfremdung*) of man, from himself and from nature, appears in the relation in which he stands to other men."

### Species-Being and the Ontology of Care

Marx’s concept of *Gattungswesen* provides the normative foundation for his critique of capitalism, though it is often misunderstood as crypto-naturalism. For Marx, what distinguishes the human species is not biological determinism but the capacity for "life-activity" that is simultaneously objective and self-directed. Humans "make their life-activity itself the object of their will and of their consciousness." This capacity establishes a particular conception of care (*Sorge*) as species-activity rather than private sentiment. In producing for another, in creating social wealth, the human being confirms his "real social life" and realizes his species-nature.

Capitalism harms precisely by severing this connection between individual activity and species-care. When labor becomes *Lohnarbeit* (wage labor), the worker cares for himself only as a means of maintaining his labor-power as a commodity for his employer; his social relation to others is mediated not by conscious mutual provision but by the "cash nexus." The specific cruelty of capitalist harm lies in its reduction of care from a species-activity to a transaction. The vulnerable are not protected by the conscious solidarity of *Gattungswesen* but abandoned to the "dull compulsion of economic relations" (*stumpfe Gewalt der ökonomischen Verhältnisse*).

### The Materialist Critique of Moral Ideology

If the 1844 Manuscripts present capitalism as harmful to human nature, *Die deutsche Ideologie* (written 1845–1846 with Friedrich Engels) complicates this picture by arguing that "morality" itself is an ideological superstructure determined by the material base. Marx and Engels contend that "the ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships." This poses an apparent paradox: if moral concepts including care, protection, and harm are merely ideological reflections of bourgeois production relations, how can Marx consistently claim that capitalism is *objectively* harmful?

The resolution lies in Marx’s distinction between "ideology" (*Ideologie*)—which masks real contradictions—and genuine "human relations" (*menschliche Verhältnisse*). In *Die deutsche Ideologie*, Marx argues that pre-capitalist forms of care (feudal obligations, guild solidarity, familial *Sittlichkeit*) were not merely ideological illusions but embodied forms of direct social interdependence appropriate to earlier modes of production. Capitalism destroys these forms not because it liberates humanity from false moral constraints, but because it substitutes real human dependencies with abstract monetary dependencies. The moral harm of capitalism is thus double: it destroys actual protective structures while generating idealistic moral philosophies (Kantian duty, utilitarian welfare) that mystify the real conditions of existence. The demand for care in bourgeois society functions as what Marx later terms a "fetishistic" mask: it presents as ethical failure what is in fact structural necessity. For Marx, the protection of the vulnerable requires not better moral ideology but the transformation of the material conditions that make vulnerability profitable.

### Commodity Fetishism and the Erosion of Social Bonds

The mature analysis of this mystification appears in Chapter 1, Section 4 of *Das Kapital* (1867), where Marx develops the theory of *Warenfetischismus* (commodity fetishism). Here Marx argues that in commodity-producing society, "the social character of men’s labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour; as the natural forms of the products of labour." The commodity form conceals the social relations between people behind the "fantastic form" of relations between things. A table, "as soon as it steps forth as a commodity... stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas."

The implications for care and protection are profound. When social relations are mediated by the market, the recognition of the other’s vulnerability is systematically obscured. The capitalist does not directly compel the worker; he purchases labor-power as he would any other commodity. The harm done is invisible because it is systemic: "Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer." The extraction of *Mehrwert* (surplus value) appears not as theft but as fair exchange—equal values for equal values—even as it simultaneously generates "pauperism" and the "industrial reserve army" that keep the worker in a state of structural vulnerability.

Under commodity fetishism, care becomes alienated into the purchase of services. The protection of the vulnerable is not a social obligation visible to all participants but a private consumption choice. The nursing home, the insurance policy, the private security detail—these become the fetishized forms of care, commodities that obliterate the direct human recognition of need. As Marx notes, commodity production converts "every product into a social hieroglyphic," rendering opaque the social labor—and the human dependency—that produced it.

### Exploitation as Structural Harm

Central to Marx’s critique is the labor theory of value and the theory of exploitation. Unlike liberal critics who view capitalist harm as a matter of distributive injustice (unfair wages), Marx conceives exploitation as a structural feature of valorization (*Verwertung*). The worker is formally free (*formell frei*) to sell his labor-power to any capitalist, thereby appearing to enter into a voluntary contract. Yet this formal freedom masks real coercion: "The domain of freedom really begins only where labour determined by necessity and external expediency ends."

The harm consists in the extraction of surplus value—the difference between the value of labor-power (the cost of reproducing the worker) and the value created by labor. This is not merely unfair but constitutive of a specific form of domination. The worker’s life-time is stolen, converted into the capitalist’s capital. As Marx writes in *Das Kapital*: "Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour

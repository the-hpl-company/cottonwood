### The German Tradition of Suffering and Ethics: Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and the Question of Moral Foundations

The German philosophical tradition of the 19th century produced two monumental and diametrically opposed responses to the problems of suffering, harm, and the grounds of moral responsibility. In Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, we encounter not merely differing ethical systems, but fundamentally antagonistic metaphysical visions of reality, from which their conceptions of care, compassion, and the proper human stance toward pain logically flow. Their debate constitutes a pivotal chapter in Western thought, dismantling Enlightenment optimism and forcing a radical reconsideration of whether morality is rooted in empathy, power, or something beyond both.

#### **Arthur Schopenhauer: The Metaphysics of Suffering and the Ethics of Compassion**

Schopenhauer’s philosophy, systematically presented in his masterwork *Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung* (*The World as Will and Representation*, 1818/1844), begins with a stark metaphysical claim. The world of individual objects and persons—the world of “representation” (*Vorstellung*)—is mere appearance. The underlying, nonmenal reality is a blind, purposeless, eternally striving force he terms “Will” (*Wille*). This Will objectifies itself at every level of nature, from gravity to animal instinct to human desire. Since the essence of Will is endless striving toward goals that, once attained, yield only boredom or new wants, the fundamental condition of all existence is suffering (*Leiden*). “All life is suffering,” Schopenhauer states, because “all striving springs from want or deficiency, from dissatisfaction with one’s condition, and is therefore suffering so long as it is not satisfied” (*Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung*, Vol. I, §56). This metaphysical pessimism provides the bleak backdrop for his ethics.

For Schopenhauer, genuine morality arises only through the transcendence of the *principium individuationis*—the illusory boundary between self and other created by representation. The egoistic drives of the individual will are the source of all harm. True virtue, therefore, must be non-egoistic. He identifies this source in **Mitleid**, or compassion, which he defines as the direct, intuitive identification with the suffering of another. “My own true inner being exists in every living creature… This is the ground of compassion (*Mitleid*)… and it is this which is here proved to be the source of all genuine, that is, unselfish, virtue” (*Über die Grundlage der Moral*, §22). In the act of compassion, “the *miseri* and the *egoisti* are so to speak fused together; their difference is abolished.” The suffering of another becomes my own, and action to alleviate it becomes as immediate as action to alleviate my own pain. This makes compassion the sole foundation for justice and loving-kindness, the two cardinal virtues.

Schopenhauer’s ethics of *Mitleid* led him to a conclusion radical for his time: moral consideration must extend beyond humanity. He systematically argued that the same Will objectifies itself in all sentient beings, and thus the moral imperative of compassion knows no species boundary. He chastised Western ethics for its anthropocentrism, writing, “The morality that stops at humanity and does not embrace all that breathes is a fragment of morality” (*Parerga und Paralipomena*, Vol. II, §177). His condemnation of cruelty to animals was not based on utility or rights, but on the metaphysical recognition of shared essence and shared suffering, making him a foundational figure for the animal rights tradition.

Yet, for Schopenhauer, compassion, while morally supreme, is only a partial salve. The highest ethical and spiritual response to the universal fact of suffering is not social reform but the **denial of the Will** (*Verneinung des Willens*). Inspired by his deep engagement with Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist thought—he was among the first major Western philosophers to integrate Eastern philosophy seriously—Schopenhauer saw in asceticism, resignation, and the quieting of desire the ultimate negation of the world’s painful ground. The saint or sage who achieves this denial does not harm others because the will-to-live within them has been stilled. This ascetic ideal represents a turn inward, away from worldly engagement, toward a state akin to Nirvana.

#### **Friedrich Nietzsche: The Transvaluation of Pity and the Affirmation of Life**

Nietzsche’s philosophy is, in large part, a sustained and furious assault on Schopenhauer’s premises and conclusions. Accepting the death of God—the collapse of any transcendent, metaphysical foundation for value, as proclaimed in *Die fröhliche Wissenschaft* (*The Gay Science*, 1882, §125)—Nietzsche sought not a path of resignation, but a radical affirmation of life in its totality, suffering included.

His genealogical method, most powerfully deployed in *Zur Genealogie der Moral* (*On the Genealogy of Morality*, 1887), aims to debunk the supposed self-evidence of compassion-based ethics. He argues that the moral dichotomy of “good and evil” is not natural but historical, born from **ressentiment**. “Slave morality” originates when the powerless, unable to act on their instincts, creatively label their oppressors’ strength “evil” and their own weakness “good.” This “revaluation of values” transforms pity, humility, and altruism from signs of failure into virtues. For Nietzsche, this morality is life-denying; it glorifies what is reactive and condemns the spontaneous, active “will to power” (*Wille zur Macht*)—the fundamental drive not merely to dominate others, but to overcome oneself, to grow and create.

It is here that Nietzsche launches his direct critique of Schopenhauerian *Mitleid*. In *Jenseits von Gut und Böse* (*Beyond Good and Evil*, 1886) and elsewhere, Nietzsche argues that pity is not a pure, selfless identification but a complex, often insidious, psychological phenomenon. It is a form of power, an assertion of superiority disguised as benevolence. More dangerously, it multiplies suffering: “Pity (*Mitleid*)… preserves what is ripe for destruction; it defends life’s disinherited and condemned… Pity is the *practice* of nihilism” (*Der Antichrist*, §7). He contends that pity weakens both the pitier, by draining their vitality, and the pitied, by reinforcing their sense of victimhood. “Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality… it is a *depressant*” (*Die fröhliche Wissenschaft*, §338).

Nietzsche’s alternative is not cruelty, but a strength that can encompass care without degenerating into pity. The **Übermensch**, as presented in *Also sprach Zarathustra* (*Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, 1883-85), is the creator of values, one who has overcome the “human, all-too-human” morality of good and evil. For such a spirit, care could be an expression of overflowing strength, a generosity that comes from abundance, not from a sense of shared deficiency. The ultimate test for this life-affirming spirit is the thought experiment of the **eternal recurrence** (*ewige Wiederkehr*): “What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more’… Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: ‘You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine’” (*Die fröhliche Wissenschaft*, §341). To affirm one’s life, with all its suffering and joy, as eternally recurring is the ultimate “Yes” (*Ja-sagen*).

This culminates in the ideal of **amor fati** (love of fate): “My formula for greatness in a human being is *amor fati*: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it… but *love* it” (*Ecce Homo*, “Why I Am So Clever,” §10). Here, the contrast with Schopenhauer is absolute. Where Schopenhauer advocates resignation and denial in the face of suffering, Nietzsche demands a transformative affirmation that makes one’s suffering meaningful as a necessary part of one’s self-overcoming.

#### **Legacy and Contested Terrain**

The schism between these two visions echoes through contemporary thought. Schopenhauer’s metaphysics of universal suffering and his ethics of compassion directly influenced the animal rights movement and resonate with certain strands of utilitarian and care ethics. Nietzsche’s legacy is more fractious. His genealogical critique dismantles the self-certainty of moral systems, a method profoundly adopted by Michel Foucault. His demand for value-creation in a godless world fuels existentialism, as seen in Albert Camus’s imperative to “imagine Sisyphus happy”—to find defiant joy within absurd, unceasing labor.

The central, unresolved debate is whether Nietzsche’s philosophy can accommodate any robust ethics of care. His scorn for pity seems to reject it outright. Yet, his praise for “gift-giving virtue” and the care that flows from strength suggests a possible, albeit aristocratic and demanding, reconceptualization of care—one divorced from *ressentiment* and grounded in the affirmation of life’s totality. What Schopenhauer and Nietzsche jointly bequeath to the library of human thought is the inescapable depth of the problem: the foundations of our concern for the suffering other are neither simple nor self-evident, but are buried in our most fundamental assumptions about the nature of reality and the will to live within it.

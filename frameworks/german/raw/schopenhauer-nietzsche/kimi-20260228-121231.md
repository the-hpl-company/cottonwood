**Between Pity and Power: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on Suffering, Care, and the Grounds of Ethics**

The post-Kantian philosophical landscape in the German tradition fractured sharply over the question of suffering (*Leiden*) and its moral significance. While Immanuel Kant sought to ground ethics in the rational autonomy of the subject, Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche inaugurated a radical revaluation that placed the phenomena of pain, vulnerability, and care at the center of metaphysical inquiry. Yet where Schopenhauer discovered in universal suffering the basis for a compassionate ethics (*Mitleidsethik*) that would extend even to non-human animals, Nietzsche diagnosed that same compassion as a symptom of decline, proposing instead an affirmative relationship to suffering through the will to power (*Wille zur Macht*) and love of fate (*amor fati*). Their opposed systems—pessimistic metaphysics versus genealogical critique—remain foundational for contemporary debates regarding the nature of harm, the scope of moral responsibility, and the possibility of care without resentment.

**The World as Will: Schopenhauer’s Metaphysics of Suffering**

In *Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung* (1819; expanded 1844), Schopenhauer dismantled the Kantian division between phenomenon and noumenon only to reveal a darker reality beneath the veil of representation (*Vorstellung*). Where Kant had left the thing-in-itself (*Ding an sich*) unknowable, Schopenhauer identified it immediately in our own bodies as *Wille*—blind, ceaseless, goal-less striving. This Will, manifesting as the "will-to-live" (*Wille zum Leben*), constitutes the inner essence of every phenomenon, from the gravitational pull of stones to the erotic drive of organisms. Yet precisely because the Will is infinite striving without final satisfaction, existence is structurally tragic. Schopenhauer writes that "all life is suffering" (*alles Leben ist Leiden*), not merely accidentally but essentially: "Want is the rule, satisfaction the exception; suffering is the rule, pleasure the exception." In this cosmology, harm is not a deviation from natural order but its fundamental expression; the world is "hell" (*die Welt ist die Hölle*), and the only relief available to the individual lies in the temporary cessation of desire, never in its permanent fulfillment.

**The Ethics of Compassion and the Expansion of the Moral Circle**

Against this metaphysical pessimism, Schopenhauer constructed an ethics grounded in *Mitleid* (compassion or literally "suffering-with"), which he presented in *Über die Grundlage der Moral* (1840) and Book IV of *Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung*. Genuine moral action, he argued, cannot derive from Kantian duty or utilitarian calculation, for these remain ultimately egoistic. True morality arises instead from the direct recognition that the distinction between oneself and others is merely phenomenal; metaphysically, there is one Will manifesting in all beings. When compassion occurs, "their suffering becomes my suffering" (*ihr Leiden wird zu meinem Leiden*), not through imaginative projection but through the penetration of the principium individuationis. This identification constitutes the sole "non-egoistic" basis for ethics, transforming the perception of another's injury into an immediate experience of harm to oneself.

This metaphysical insight led Schopenhauer to one of the earliest systematic arguments for animal rights in Western philosophy. Rejecting Cartesian mechanism that viewed animals as *automata*, he insisted that because animals are immediate objectifications of the same Will that constitutes human subjectivity, their suffering demands moral consideration. "The morality that stops at humanity and does not embrace all that breathes is a fragment of morality," he contended, anticipating contemporary care ethics by over a century. For Schopenhauer, the expansion of the moral circle to include "all that breathes" (*alles, was athmet*) follows necessarily from the dissolution of egoistic barriers through compassionate knowledge.

**The Ascetic Denial of the Will**

Yet compassion (*Mitleid*) remains, for Schopenhauer, only a preliminary stage. The highest ethical response to universal suffering is not reform or political amelioration but the *Verneinung des Willens*—the denial or negation of the Will itself. In the lives of saints, ascetics, and mystics, Schopenhauer perceived the "sublime transition" where knowledge, turning against the Will that engenders all suffering, achieves a quieting (*Stillstellung*) of desire. This is not suicide, which is a violent affirmation of the Will, but rather the "shining of the sun without warmth"—continued bodily existence without the sting of willing. Here Schopenhauer’s ethics intersects explicitly with Hindu and Buddhist thought: the world of representation (*Maya*) is illusion, and salvation lies in the extinction of desire analogous to nirvana. The ethical subject who recognizes that "the same will-to-live is objectified in the aggressor and the victim" must ultimately renounce the will-to-live itself, finding in negation the only possible care for a world of inevitable harm.

**Genealogy and the Critique of Pity: Nietzsche’s Inversion**

Nietzsche’s philosophical project emerged through a direct confrontation with Schopenhauerian pessimism, which he gradually reinterpreted not as wisdom but as decadence. In *Zur Genealogie der Moral* (1887) and *Jenseits von Gut und Böse* (1886), Nietzsche subjected morality itself to historical analysis, arguing that the categories of "good and evil" (*gut und böse*) do not reflect eternal truths but represent the triumph of *ressentiment*—the creative vengeance of the weak against the strong. Master morality (*Herrenmoral*) operated through the affirmative distinction of "good and bad" (*gut und schlecht*), evaluating actions according to noble or base origins; slave morality (*Sklavenmoral*), by contrast, inverted these values, declaring the powerful "evil" and the suffering "good." This genealogical insight revealed that moral systems ostensibly concerned with care and protection actually functioned as mechanisms of power, protecting the "herd" (*Herde*) against the exceptional individual.

Nietzsche’s assault on *Mitleid*—the cornerstone of Schopenhauer’s ethics—was relentless. In *Zur Genealogie der Moral*, Third Essay, and throughout *Also sprach Zarathustra* (1883–1885), he argued that pity is not altruistic care but a refined form of self-gratification and power. "Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality," he wrote in *Der Antichrist* (1895); it increases the sum of suffering by infecting the observer with the weakness of the sufferer. Pity preserves what ought to perish, depresses the vital energies, and represents a "narcotic" that renders both subject and object sick. For Nietzsche, genuine care cannot consist in the multiplication of suffering through sympathetic identification; rather, it requires the discipline of strength that allows others to endure, overcome, and grow.

**The Will to Power and the Affirmation of Existence**

Where Schopenhauer found the fundamental reality to be the suffering Will, Nietzsche posited the *Wille zur Macht* (will to power) as the basic drive of all life. Crucially, this is not merely the will to dominate others but primarily the drive toward self-overcoming (*Selbstüberwindung*)—the "spontaneous, aggressive, expansive, form-giving" forces that characterize healthy organisms. In *Jenseits von Gut und Böse* (§259), Nietzsche describes the will to power as "the will of the center to incorporate, to grow, to expand its power." The Übermensch (overman) emerges not as a tyrant but as the being capable of creating new values beyond the "good and evil" inherited from metaphysical traditions. For such a being, care manifests not as the elimination of suffering but as the cultivation of conditions for greatness; harm is not inherently evil but potentially the necessary spur to "higher types."

This affirmative stance finds its most rigorous formulation in the thought of *ewige Wiederkehr* (eternal recurrence), introduced in *Die fröhliche Wissenschaft* (1882/1887), §341. The "greatest weight" (*das größte Schwergewicht*) falls upon the subject who imagines a demon announcing that "this life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more." The test lies not in endurance but in affirmation: would you cry "yes" to the demon? This "formula for greatness in a human being" (*amor fati*) requires loving necessity itself, including "nothing in it aside from what is necessary." Unlike Schopenhauer’s ascetic negation, Nietzschean affirmation embraces suffering as integral to the aesthetic totality of existence; the highest care is the transformation of one’s relationship to pain, not its abolition.

**The Death of God and the Crisis of Foundations**

Nietzsche’s proclamation of the "death of God" (*Gott ist tot*) in *Die fröhliche Wissenschaft* (§125) signals not triumph but a crisis of unprecedented gravity. With the collapse of metaphysical foundations, the Schopenhauerian project of compassion grounded in the unity of the Will loses its transcendental warrant; similarly, Christian-pity morality loses its divine sanction. "God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown." The shadow includes both the ascetic ideal and the humanitarianism derived from it. Yet this nihilism also creates the space for a "revaluation of all values" (*Umwertung aller Werte*). Ethics cannot be grounded in the elimination of suffering—an impossible goal that leads to the "last man" (*letzter Mensch*)—but in the creation of meaning that incorporates suffering into a life-affirming narrative.

**Legacies and Living Questions**

The divergence between Schopenhauer’s compassionate world-denial and Nietzsche’s affirmative world-acceptance reverberates through twentieth-century thought. Existentialism absorbed Nietzsche’s challenge: Albert Camus’s Sisyphus, condemned to eternal struggle yet affirming his fate, embodies the *amor fati* that refuses Schopenhauerian resignation. Michel Foucault’s genealogical method in works like *Surveiller et punir* (1975) extends Nietzsche’s historical critique of moral categories, analyzing how discourses of care and protection operate as technologies of power. Meanwhile, the debate within care ethics remains unresolved: theorists like Nel Noddings find in Schopenhauer’s *Mitleid* a precursor to relational ethics, while others argue that Nietzsche’s critique of pity clears the ground for a robust care ethics liberated from condescension and resentment.

Between the denial of the Will and the eternal yes, between compassion as metaphysical insight and pity as life-denying weakness, these two thinkers established the poles around which modern reflection on harm and care continues to orbit. Schopenhauer teaches that to perceive harm is to suffer it, demanding an ethics of radical inclusion that extends to all sentient beings; Nietzsche responds that to truly care is to affirm the suffering necessary for human flourishing, rejecting the paralysis of pity. Their dialogue—carried out across the texts of *Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung*, *Zur Genealogie der Moral*, and *Also sprach Zarathustra*—remains essential for any civilization reasoning about the protection of the vulnerable without succumbing to the "morality of decline."

### Harm, Care, and Protection in Indian Philosophical Traditions

Indian philosophical traditions offer a rich and multifaceted discourse on harm, duties of care, and the protection of vulnerable populations. These concepts are explored through diverse lenses, ranging from the individual ethical conduct prescribed by *ahimsa* to the pragmatic statecraft outlined in the *Arthashastra*. This survey examines key concepts and historical examples across various schools of thought, highlighting both the common threads and the points of contention.

#### Ahimsa: The Principle of Non-Harm

*Ahimsa*, often translated as non-violence or non-harming, is a central tenet in Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. While the term itself appears in various ancient texts, its significance as a foundational ethical principle solidified over centuries. In Jainism, *ahimsa* is the supreme virtue. Jain monastic practice involves extreme measures to avoid harming any living being, including insects and microorganisms. This commitment extends to both physical and mental actions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all life.

Buddhist interpretations of *ahimsa* emphasize the avoidance of harm through mindful action and speech. The *Dhammapada* (129-130) states, "All tremble at violence; all fear death. Comparing oneself with others, one should not kill or cause to kill." This perspective highlights the universality of suffering and the ethical imperative to minimize harm. In Hinduism, *ahimsa* is considered a cardinal virtue (*yama*) in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras (2.35), forming a foundation for ethical conduct. However, the application of *ahimsa* within Hinduism has been subject to varied interpretations, particularly in relation to social duties and the use of force in specific circumstances.

The concept of *ahimsa* extends beyond individual conduct to encompass institutional and social obligations. It calls for creating social structures that minimize harm and promote well-being. This broader application raises complex questions about the role of the state, the justice system, and economic practices in upholding *ahimsa*.

#### The Dharma Traditions: Duty, Compassion, and Conflict

The *dharma* traditions of Hinduism provide a complex framework for understanding duties of care, often rooted in the concept of *svadharma*, one's own duty or role-specific obligations. The *Bhagavad Gita* explores the tension between duty and compassion through the dilemma of Arjuna. Faced with the prospect of fighting his relatives in battle, Arjuna is overwhelmed by grief and contemplates abandoning his *dharma* as a warrior. Krishna advises him to fulfill his duty, arguing that inaction in the face of injustice is also a form of harm. The *Gita* (2.31) states, "Considering also your own duty as a warrior, you should not waver, for there is no greater good for a warrior than a battle fought according to *dharma*."

However, the *Gita*'s emphasis on *svadharma* raises ethical questions about the potential for conflict between caste duties and universal compassion. Critics argue that the traditional *dharma* framework can perpetuate social hierarchies and justify harm inflicted upon marginalized groups. Arjuna's dilemma remains a powerful case study in the complexities of harm reasoning, forcing individuals to confront the ethical implications of their actions and the potential for conflicting duties.

#### Buddhist Compassion (Karuṇā) and Emptiness

In Buddhism, compassion (*karuṇā*) is intrinsically linked to the understanding of suffering and the path to liberation. The Four Noble Truths identify suffering (*dukkha*) as a fundamental aspect of human existence and offer a path to end it. This framework provides a foundation for understanding harm as a manifestation of suffering and compassion as a means of alleviating it.

The Bodhisattva ideal embodies the highest expression of compassion. Bodhisattvas are individuals who have attained enlightenment but choose to postpone their own final liberation in order to help all other beings overcome suffering. This selfless commitment to the well-being of others is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism. Nagarjuna, a prominent philosopher of the Madhyamaka school, argues that all phenomena are empty (*sunyata*) of inherent existence and are interdependent. This understanding of emptiness implies that the suffering of one being is connected to the well-being of all others, reinforcing the importance of compassion and the need to minimize harm.

#### Ashoka's Edicts: Translating Philosophy into Governance

The reign of Emperor Ashoka (3rd century BCE) provides a compelling historical example of a ruler attempting to translate philosophical principles of non-harm into governance policy. Following a bloody conquest of Kalinga, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and embraced a policy of *dhamma-vijaya* (conquest through *dharma*). His edicts, inscribed on rocks and pillars throughout his empire, articulate his commitment to non-violence, compassion, and the welfare of his subjects.

Ashoka's edicts emphasize the importance of non-violence towards all living beings, including animals. He banned animal sacrifices, promoted vegetarianism, and established hospitals for both humans and animals. The Rock Edict II states, "Everywhere in the dominions of King Piyadasi [Ashoka]...two kinds of medical treatment were established: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals."

Ashoka also implemented policies aimed at promoting social justice and protecting vulnerable populations. He appointed officials to oversee the welfare of women, children, and the elderly, and he encouraged tolerance and understanding among different religious groups. Ashoka's edicts demonstrate the potential for ethical principles to inform governance and promote a more just and compassionate society. However, scholars debate the extent to which Ashoka's policies were truly effective and whether his emphasis on *dhamma* served political as well as ethical goals.

#### The Arthashastra: Pragmatic Statecraft and the Protection of the People

In contrast to the emphasis on *ahimsa* in many Indian philosophical traditions, the *Arthashastra*, attributed to Kautilya, presents a pragmatic framework for statecraft that prioritizes the security and prosperity of the kingdom. The *Arthashastra* argues that the king's primary duty is to protect (*raksha*) the people, even if it requires the use of deception and force.

Kautilya acknowledges the importance of ethical conduct but argues that the king must be willing to act ruthlessly when necessary to defend the state and maintain order. The *Arthashastra* advocates for a strong military, a well-organized bureaucracy, and a sophisticated system of espionage. While the text emphasizes the importance of just governance and the welfare of the people, it also recognizes the realities of power politics and the need for strategic calculation. The *Arthashastra* thus presents a tension between the ethical ideals of *ahimsa* and the practical demands of statecraft, raising questions about the limits of non-violence in the face of existential threats.

#### Gandhian Satyagraha: Non-Violence as Active Care

Mahatma Gandhi transformed the concept of *ahimsa* into a powerful tool for social and political change through his philosophy of *satyagraha*, or "truth force." Gandhi argued that non-violence is not passive withdrawal but rather an active form of resistance that seeks to convert the opponent through love and understanding. He believed that *ahimsa* requires confronting injustice and challenging oppressive systems, even at great personal cost.

Gandhi drew inspiration from various sources, including the *Bhagavad Gita*, which he interpreted as an allegory for the internal struggle between good and evil. He emphasized the importance of selfless action (*nishkama karma*) and the need to detach oneself from the fruits of one's labor. Gandhi's interpretation of the *Gita* provided a philosophical foundation for his commitment to non-violent resistance. Gandhi's *satyagraha* campaigns in South Africa and India demonstrated the power of non-violent action to challenge injustice and promote social change. His philosophy continues to inspire movements for peace and justice around the world.

#### The Dalit Critique: Challenging Harm Through Structural Justice

B.R. Ambedkar, a prominent Dalit leader and social reformer, offered a critical perspective on traditional *dharma* frameworks and their role in perpetuating social inequality. Ambedkar argued that the caste system, rooted in Hindu scriptures and social practices, was a fundamental source of harm and injustice. He challenged the notion of *svadharma* as a justification for maintaining the caste hierarchy and advocated for the abolition of caste altogether.

Ambedkar argued that true care ethics must include a commitment to structural justice and the dismantling of oppressive systems. He believed that the Dalit community, historically subjected to discrimination and violence, could only achieve true liberation through political empowerment and social transformation. Ambedkar's critique of caste provides a powerful reminder that ethical principles must be applied to address systemic forms of harm and injustice.

#### Tamil Sangam Ethics: Aram and the Ruler's Duty

The Tamil Sangam literature, a collection of poems composed between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, offers insights into the ethical values of ancient Tamil society. The concept of *aram*, often translated as virtue or duty, is a central theme in Sangam literature. The *Thirukkural*, a classic Tamil text attributed to Thiruvalluvar, provides a comprehensive guide to ethical living, encompassing personal conduct, social relationships, and governance.

The *Thirukkural* emphasizes the importance of compassion, justice, and the ruler's duty to protect the vulnerable. It advocates for a just and equitable society in which all members are treated with dignity and respect. The *Thirukkural* (546) states, "That is the true government which shields its people from harm, supplies them with wealth, and cherishes the good." Thiruvalluvar's teachings highlight the ethical responsibilities of leadership and the importance of creating a society that promotes the well-being of all its citizens.

In conclusion, Indian philosophical traditions offer a rich and diverse tapestry of ethical perspectives on harm, duties of care, and the protection of vulnerable populations. From the emphasis on *ahimsa* in Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to the pragmatic statecraft outlined in the *Arthashastra*, these traditions provide a range of frameworks for understanding and addressing ethical challenges. The historical examples of Ashoka's reign, Gandhi's *satyagraha* movement, and Ambedkar's critique of caste demonstrate the ongoing relevance of these philosophical traditions to contemporary debates about social justice and the pursuit of a more compassionate and equitable world.

# Buddhist Ethical Thought: Harm, Care, and Stewardship

This analysis situates Buddhist ethics within its soteriological framework, emphasizing the diagnosis of harm (dukkha) through craving and conditioning, the cultivation of care via ethical precepts and mental training, and stewardship as responsible agency amid interdependence (paticcasamuppada). Drawing from the Pali Canon (Theravada), Mahayana sutras, and tantric traditions, it highlights intra-Buddhist tensions: individual vs. altruistic liberation, precept adherence vs. skillful means, and monastic rigor vs. lay adaptation. Historical distortions—such as colonial romanticizations of "non-violence" ignoring martial patronage or modern secular appropriations flattening karma into mere psychology—are noted without resolution.

## 1. The Four Noble Truths as Ethical Framework

The Four Noble Truths (catvari aryasatyani), proclaimed in the Buddha's first sermon, *Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta* (SN 56.11), form Buddhism's ethical architecture. They diagnose harm not as metaphysical pessimism but as empirical phenomenology, urging stewardship through cessation.

- **Dukkha (Suffering) as Ethical Starting Point**: Dukkha is the pervasive unsatisfactoriness of samsaric existence, grounding ethics in harm's universality. The *Salayatana Samyutta* (SN 36.22) enumerates three marks: *dukkha-dukkha* (ordinary pain: birth, aging, death, sorrow; SN 36.19); *viparinama-dukkha* (suffering in impermanence: pleasure's evanescence; AN 3.47); *sankhara-dukkha* (conditioned suffering: the existential unease of all fabrications; SN 22.56). This triad avoids nihilism—dukkha is actionable, not final—prompting care via detachment (nekkhamma).

- **Samudaya (Origin of Suffering)**: Craving (*tanha*)—for sensuality (*kama-tanha*), existence (*bhava-tanha*), non-existence (*vibhava-tanha*)—drives ethical failure (SN 56.11). It manifests as the three poisons: *raga* (sensual greed), *dosa* (aversion/hatred), *moha* (delusion/ignorance), per *Dvayatanasutta* (MN 140). These poison interdependence, yielding harm: greed exploits, hatred destroys, delusion blinds to consequences. Ethics counters via wisdom exposing tanha's futility.

- **Nirodha (Cessation)**: Suffering's end (*nibbana*) is an ethical claim of realizable freedom (SN 56.11). Not annihilation but unbinding from conditioning, it models stewardship: harm is contingent, not fated. Tensions arise in interpretation—Theravada's locative nibbana (SN 43.1-44) vs. Mahayana's non-abiding nirvana (Lotus Sutra, ch. 2).

- **Magga (Path)**: The Noble Eightfold Path integrates wisdom, morality, and concentration as holistic ethics, transcending rules for transformative practice (SN 45.8).

## 2. The Eightfold Path as Ethical Architecture

The Path (*ariyo atthangiko maggo*), detailed in *Mahasatipatthana Sutta* (DN 22) and *Saccavibhanga Sutta* (MN 141), interweaves cognition, conduct, and meditation. Interdependent (not linear), it fosters harm's avoidance, care's extension, and mindful stewardship.

- **Wisdom (Prajna)**: 
  - *Right View (Samma Ditthi)*: Grasping Four Truths, karma, and not-self (*anatta*; MN 141). Ethical vision discerns harm's roots without moralism.
  - *Right Intention (Samma Sankappa)*: Renunciation, non-ill will (*avyapada*), harmlessness (*avihimsa*; MN 117). Counters poisons via resolve.

- **Morality (Sila)**:
  - *Right Speech (Samma Vaca)*: Abstaining from lies, divisive talk, harsh words, idle chatter (MN 141). Protects social fabric.
  - *Right Action (Samma Kammanta)*: No killing, stealing, sexual misconduct (MN 141). Bodily non-harm.
  - *Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva)*: Avoiding trades in weapons (*sattha-vanijja*), living beings (*satta-vanijja*: slavery/trafficking), meat (*mamsa-vanijja*), intoxicants (*majja-vanijja*), poisons (*visa-vanijja*; AN 5.177, *Vanijja Sutta*). Modern translation: rejects militarism, exploitation (e.g., labor trafficking), factory farming (animal commodification), addiction industries (pharma/alcohol), toxics (pollution/chemicals). Tensions: historical meat-eating monastics (Vin. III.212) vs. ahimsa absolutism; economic stewardship demands systemic critique, per contemporary applications (e.g., Engaged Buddhism).

- **Concentration (Samadhi)**:
  - *Right Effort (Samma Vayama)*: Preventing unwholesome states, abandoning arisen ones, generating wholesome (SN 45.8).
  - *Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati)*: Four Foundations (body, feelings, mind, dhammas; MN 10). Vigilant care.
  - *Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi)*: Jhanas as ethical purification (AN 5.28).

## 3. Vinaya Rules for Monastic Conduct

The *Vinaya Pitaka* codifies ethics for harmony (*samacariya*). *Patimokkha* (monastic code): 227 rules for bhikkhus (Vin. I-IV), 311 for bhikkhunis (Vin. IV), graded by severity.

- **Four Parajikas (Defeats)**: Expulsion for (1) human killing (*panatipada*; Vin. I.83, cf. intentionality clause); (2) theft (*adinna* > crop value; Vin. I.97); (3) sexual intercourse (any; Vin. II.12, monastic celibacy as renunciation); (4) false superhuman claims (*uttari manussa dhamma*; Vin. II.87). These safeguard community trust.

Lay ethics mirror via Five Precepts (*pancasila*: no killing, stealing, misconduct, intoxicants, false speech; AN 8.39), intensifying monastic demands. Framework is scalar: same principles (refraining from akusala kamma), varying rigor. Lay Vinaya analogue: *Sigalovada Sutta* (DN 31).

Bhikkhuni order: Buddha ordained via Pajapati (Vin. II.253), imposing Eight Garudhammas (heavy duties to monks, e.g., subordination; Vin. II.255). Historical suppression: lineage extinct in Theravada by 11th c. (Therigatha evidence); modern revivals (e.g., Sri Lanka 1996) contest garudhammas' patriarchal bias, per feminist critiques (e.g., Anagarika Dharmapala distortions).

## 4. The Jataka Tales as Moral Instruction

*Jataka* (547 tales, Pali collection) exemplify perfections (*paramis/ paramitas*) via Buddha's past lives. Narrative ethics evokes empathy, dilemmas unresolved—contra propositional codes.

- **Vessantara Jataka (No. 547, Jat. VI.479-596)**: Prince Vessantara's dana-perfection gifts wife/children. Ethics of radical generosity: care via relinquishment, but brink of harm (children endangered). Tension: tanha's end vs. dependents' dukkha; resolves via divine intervention, highlighting bodhisattva risk.

- **Sibi Jataka (No. 499, Jat. IV.275)**: King Sibi offers flesh/eyes for dove. Self-sacrifice (*attana*) as ultimate care, but probes limits—harm to self sustainable? Pedagogical: dilemmas foster discernment.

Method: Stories cultivate karuna (compassion), avoiding casuistry; historical distortions in folk retellings romanticize excess.

## 5. Theravada vs. Mahayana Ethical Divergence

- **Theravada**: Arhat ideal—personal nibbana via precepts, path (Pali Canon authority, e.g., *Visuddhimagga*). Vinaya central; ethics individualist, harm minimized via sila. Tension: social withdrawal vs. kings' patronage (e.g., Asoka's edicts).

- **Mahayana**: Bodhisattva vow (*pranidhana*; *Bodhicaryavatara* 3.1-33) defers parinirvana for all beings' welfare. *Lotus Sutra* (Saddharmapundarika Sutra, ch. 2-3, Kumarajiva tr.) elevates upaya-kausalya (skillful means): deception permissible if liberative (e.g., provisional teachings; ch. 16). Ethical tension: consequentialism vs. absolutism—Nagarguna (*Ratnavali* 5.72) warns excess.

- **Vajrayana**: Tantric ethics (*samaya*) claim antinomianism accelerates insight—taboo-breaking (e.g., alcohol, sex in *Hevajra Tantra* I.viii) transcends dualism. Safeguard: guru-disciple bond (*Guru Yoga*; ethical dangers: abuse scandals, e.g., 20th c. Tibet). Not "anything goes"—compassion criterion (*Guhyasamaja Tantra*).

## 6. Specific Sutta/Sutra Citations

- *Dhammapada* 1.5: "Hatred is never appeased by hatred... By non-hatred alone..." (Dhp-a gloss: universal reciprocity). 10.129-130: "All tremble at violence... Putting oneself in the place of another..."

- *Sigalovada Sutta* (DN 31): Lay Vinaya—six directions: (1) Parents (support, obedience); (2) Teachers (attendance, discipline); (3) Spouse (fidelity, delegation); (4) Friends (generosity, loyalty); (5) Servants (wages, welfare); (6) Recluses (offerings, learning). Reciprocal stewardship.

- *Kalama Sutta* (AN 3.65): Epistemological ethic—test teachings by fruit (non-harm, calm), not authority/reason alone. Counters dogmatism.

- *Metta Sutta* (Sn 1.8): Radiate boundless loving-kindness (*metta*) to all, fostering universal care.

# Karuna and Metta in Buddhist Ethics: Compassion, Loving-Kindness, and the Ethical Imperative of Care

This analysis examines *karunā* (compassion) and *mettā* (loving-kindness) as foundational ethical concepts and practices within Buddhism, emphasizing their roles in personal cultivation, communal ethics, and responses to harm. Drawing from Theravāda Pāli sources, Mahāyāna sūtras, and modern interpretations, it highlights sectarian divergences (e.g., Theravāda's emphasis on individual liberation vs. Mahāyāna's bodhisattva path), internal tensions (e.g., equanimity vs. active compassion), and historical distortions (e.g., nationalist appropriations). Citations follow standard abbreviations: DN (Dīgha Nikāya), MN (Majjhima Nikāya), SN (Saṃyutta Nikāya), AN (Aṅguttara Nikāya), Sn (Sutta Nipāta); Mahāyāna texts by title and chapter/verse.

## 1. The Karaniya Metta Sutta (Sn 1.8): Structure, Maternal Metaphor, Radiating Practice, and Brahmavihāras

The *Karaniya Metta Sutta* (Sn 1.8), part of the *Sutta Nipāta*'s *Atthaka Vagga*, is a poetic exhortation to cultivate *mettā* as an ethical discipline for monks facing hostility. Its structure unfolds in three sections: (1) prerequisites for worthiness (*karaniyaṃ* atthakusalena*: virtuous conduct, restraint, moderation; vv. 1–4); (2) the core *mettā* practice (vv. 5–13); (3) outcomes and cosmic radiation (vv. 14–20).

Ethically, it frames *mettā* not as sentiment but as disciplined orientation toward universal welfare, countering hatred (*dosa*). The maternal metaphor—"Just as a mother would protect with her life her only child, so one should cultivate boundless *mettā* for all beings" (v. 8)—elevates compassion to selfless protectiveness. In Pāli commentaries (e.g., *Niddesa*), this implies *upekkhā*-informed equanimity, not possessive attachment; ethically, it commits practitioners to prioritize others' security, challenging ego-centric ethics. Theravāda tradition interprets this as *bhāvanā* (meditative development), yielding moral resilience (e.g., protection from harm, v. 12: "One does not lie down in sorrow").

Radiating *mettā* "in all directions" (*sabbalokahita*): upward/downward, across/east/west/north/south, pervading "all realms high and low" (vv. 13–14), enacts a concrete discipline. Commentarial practices (e.g., *Visuddhimagga* IX.8–11) specify visualization: sentient beings as objects, *mettā*-phrases ("May they be happy") repeated with boundless scope. Ethically, this universalizes care, dissolving in-group biases; it disciplines habitual self-preference, fostering stewardship over all life.

*Mettā* relates to the other brahmavihāras (*divine abidings*, appamaññā) as foundation: *karuṇā* (compassion for suffering), *muditā* (joy in others' success), *upekkhā* (equanimity). Sn 1.8 foregrounds *mettā*, but cross-references (e.g., AN 4.125) sequence them progressively: *mettā* wishes happiness, *karuṇā* freedom from suffering, *muditā* shared joy, *upekkhā* impartiality. Tensions arise: *mettā*'s warmth risks sentimentality without *upekkhā*'s balance (a "near enemy" per *Visuddhimagga* IX.76).

## 2. The Four Brahmavihāras as Ethical System

The brahmavihāras (AN 4.125; MN 99.7; DN 13.76) form a systematic ethic of boundless (*appamañña*) mind-states, integrating emotion with volition (*cetanā*). Theravāda Abhidhamma (e.g., *Vibhaṅga* 320ff.) classifies them as *jhāna*-factors, ethically sublime (*sobhana*) universals.

- **Mettā (loving-kindness)**: "May all beings be happy" (AN 4.125.1). Not emotional warmth (*pema*, a "near enemy" risking attachment; *Visuddhimagga* IX.76) but ethical volition for welfare, antidote to ill-will (*vyāpāda*). Practice: pervasive radiation (as Sn 1.8).

- **Karuṇā (compassion)**: "May all beings be free from suffering" (AN 4.125.2). Active (*kriya*, engagement; *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* 6.37), wishing alleviation, distinct from pity (*krpā*, passive condescension; *Visuddhimagga* IX.85). "Far enemy": cruelty (*vihiṃsā*); ethically, motivates aid without self-loss.

- **Muditā (sympathetic joy)**: "May all beings not be parted from happiness" (AN 4.125.3). Rejoicing in others' fortune, antidote to envy (*issā*). Ethical as it cultivates generosity (*dāna*), countering schadenfreude; sectarian note: Mahāyāna emphasizes it for bodhisattvas amid inequality (BCA 6.47).

- **Upekkhā (equanimity)**: Even-mindedness toward conditioned states (AN 4.125.4). Not indifference (*upekṣā* as apathy, "near enemy") but "disinterested" (*tatramajjhattatā*) engagement, rooted in insight into impermanence (*anicca*). Far enemy: worldly agitation (*uddhacca*). Theravāda tensions: *upekkhā* stabilizes prior three but risks passivity; Mahāyāna (e.g., *Śāntarakṣita's Madhyamakālaṃkāra*) integrates it with active *karuṇā*.

"Near/far enemy" schema (*Visuddhimagga* IX) reveals ethical subtlety: each counters a vice (far) but mimics a subtler distortion (near), demanding discernment.

## 3. Bodhisattva Ethics in Śāntideva's Bodhicaryāvatāra

Mahāyāna bodhisattva ethics universalizes brahmavihāras via altruism (*parārthacaryā*). Śāntideva's *Bodhicaryāvatāra* (8th c., Tibetan canon) exemplifies.

- **Chapter 6 (Kṣānti/Patience)**: Sustained non-retaliation argument. Metaphor: "Where to find leather for earth's surface? Shoes suffice" (6.13–14; var. 5.13–14 in some eds.)—endure harm internally, sparing others. Ethically, transforms victimhood into *karuṇā*, viewing harmers as suffering-driven (6.22–41). Tension: absolutist non-harm vs. defensive violence (addressed infra).

- **Chapter 8 (Dhyāna/Meditation)**: *Parātmasamatā* (equalizing self/other) and *parātmaparivartana* (exchanging self/other). Key: "All suffering arises from self-cherishing; all joy from others-cherishing" (8.129). Practice dissolves ego-clinging (*ahaṃkāra*), grounding *mettā/karuṇā* in identity exchange.

- **Tonglen** (gtong len, "giving-taking"): Breathing in suffering, out happiness (inspired BCA 8.110–11, formalized in Atiśa’s *Bodhipathapradīpa* ch. 7). Ethical logic: embodies *parivartana*, training boundless *karuṇā*; Tibetan tradition (e.g., *Lojong*) counters self-centeredness, fostering stewardship.

- **Bodhisattva vow** (3.1–4; 10.55: "As long as space endures... may I dispel world's misery"). Commits to aeons of *karuṇā*-driven action, delaying nirvāṇa for saṃsāra's welfare. Tension: Madhyamaka (Nāgārjuna, *Ratnāvalī* 3.10–12) critiques as upāya (skillful means), risking eternalism.

## 4. Engaged Buddhism: Thich Nhat Hanh and Beyond

Modern "Engaged Buddhism" (*engaged Buddhism*) adapts brahmavihāras to structural harm.

- **Thich Nhat Hanh's Fourteen Precepts** (Order of Interbeing, 1966): (1) Non-attachment to views; (2) No discussion of superiority; (3) No anger-forcing; (4) No divisiveness; (5) No glorifying killing; (6) No intoxicants; (7) No dwelling on past/future; (8) Right livelihood (no harm); (9) Truthful presence; (10) Protection of environment; (11) Respect scriptures critically; (12) Non-discrimination in sangha; (13) Shared livelihood; (14) Beauty in action. Derive from *mettā/karuṇā*, applying to Vietnam War.

- **Five Mindfulness Trainings**: Updated pātimokkha for laity: (1) Non-killing; (2) Generosity (no stealing/sex); (3) Loving speech; (4) Mindfulness of consumption; (5) True view. Frame *ahimsa* socially.

- **Interbeing** (*tiep hien*): Ontological claim (e.g., *Heart of Understanding*, 1988)—emptiness (*śūnyatā*) as interdependence—implies ethical *karuṇā*: harming others harms self (echoing BCA 8.129).

- **Buddhist Peace Fellowship** (1980s, U.S./Europe) and **Sulak Sivaraksa** (Thailand): Apply to injustice; Sivaraksa's *Seeds of Peace* (1992) critiques capitalism via *karuṇā*.

- **Ambedkar Buddhism**: 1956 mass conversion of Dalits; Navayāna rejects caste as *dukkha*, vows *mettā* equality (Ambedkar's *The Buddha and His Dhamma*, ch. 20). Ethical claim: Buddhism as liberation vehicle, diverging from caste-Hindu distortions.

## 5. The Ethics of Non-Harm (Ahimsa) in Buddhist Practice

First precept: *Pānātipātā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi* (AN 8.39; Vin I.83)—abstaining from taking life (*pāṇa*). Includes humans/animals; debates: insects (Theravāda lax, Jains strict); plants (sentience denied, SN 12.61). Mahāyāna extends via *laukika* harm (Lankāvatāra Sūtra 10).

- **Vegetarianism**: Theravāda permits "three pure meats" (*tikoṭiparisuddha*: unseen/not-for-killing/not-solicited; MN 145.13). East Asian Mahāyāna: strict, per *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* 8 ("meat-eating precludes buddhahood"). Tension: Śūnyatā undercuts absolutism.

- **Jain vs. Buddhist Ahimsa**: Shared non-violence, but Buddhists prioritize intention (*cetanā*; AN 10.176), not micro-harm (Jain *aṇuhiṃsā*); Buddhists allow defensive force (e.g., *Upāyakauśalya Sūtra*).

- **Buddhist Violence**: Sri Lanka (Sinhala-Tamil wars, justified via *dhammayuddha*); Myanmar (969 Movement, Wirathu; *maitrī* twisted as ethnic exclusion). Scholarly analysis (Jenkins): Selective *ahimsa* via identity (Theravāda *dhammarājā* ideal); historical distortions (e.g., *Mahāvaṃsa* chronicles glorify conquest).

## 6. Key Scholars

- **Harvey Aronson** (*Love and Sympathy in Theravāda Buddhism*, 1980): Analyzes brahmavihāras psychologically, distinguishing *mettā* from attachment.
- **Barbra Clayton** (*Moral Theory in Śāntideva’s Śikṣāsamuccaya*, 2006): Frames bodhisattva ethics as virtue cultivation, not consequentialism.
- **Sallie King** (*Socially Engaged Buddhism*, 2009): Typologizes engaged forms, critiquing dilution of *karuṇā*.
- **Christopher Queen** (*Engaged Buddhism in the West*, 2000): Documents global adaptations.
- **Stephen Jenkins** ("Buddhist Warfare," 2010): Examines violence doctrines, e.g., protective *karuṇā* in sūtras.

This framework reveals Buddhism's ethical dynamism: *mettā/karuṇā* as boundless yet discerning, navigating personal/mundane tensions without reductionism.

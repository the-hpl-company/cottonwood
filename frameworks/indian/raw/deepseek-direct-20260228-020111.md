## **A Survey of Harm, Care, and Protection in Indian Philosophical Traditions**

Indian philosophical traditions have developed sophisticated, diverse, and often contested frameworks for reasoning about harm, duties of care, and the protection of the vulnerable. These frameworks range from absolute metaphysical injunctions to pragmatic political doctrines, creating a rich tapestry of ethical discourse centered on the nature of suffering and the obligations it imposes.

### **I. Ahimsa: The Foundational Principle of Non-Harm**

The concept of *ahimsa* (non-injury, non-harm) serves as a cornerstone for ethical reasoning across multiple Indian traditions, though its interpretation and scope vary significantly.

In **Jainism**, *ahimsa* attains its most radical and absolute formulation. It is the foremost of the five *mahavratas* (great vows) for ascetics. Rooted in a metaphysical dualism that sees infinite souls (*jiva*) trapped in matter (*ajiva*), harm is defined as any violence to these life-forces, which are categorized by the number of senses they possess. The *Acaranga Sutra* commands: "All beings are fond of life; they like pleasure and hate pain, shun destruction and like to live, they long to live. To all, life is dear." (I.2.3). This extends care to all living beings, mandating strict vegetarianism and professions that minimize harm, institutionalizing non-violence as a core social and individual obligation.

**Buddhism** situates *ahimsa* within the framework of the Four Noble Truths. Harm (*himsa*) is intrinsically linked to suffering (*dukkha*) and its origin in craving (*tanha*). The first precept for lay followers is to abstain from taking life. The *Dhammapada* states: "All tremble at violence; all fear death. Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill." (v. 129). Here, *ahimsa* is coupled with an empathetic reasoning grounded in the universal desire to avoid suffering. For the monastic community (*Sangha*), it formed the basis for rules governing harmony and collective care.

In the **Hindu** tradition, *ahimsa* evolves from a Vedic ritual purity concept into a central ethical virtue (*yama*), especially in the *Dharmashastra* literature and the Yoga system. It is often paired with positive duties of care (*daya*, compassion). The *Mahabharata* repeatedly extols it: "*Ahimsa* is the highest duty (*dharma*), the highest truth, the highest austerity." (Shanti Parva 245.5). Its application, however, frequently intersects with and is complicated by other social and ritual duties.

### **II. Dharma, Svadharma, and the Tension of Compassion: The Bhagavad Gita**

The *Bhagavad Gita* presents a seminal case study in reasoning about harm through the lens of *svadharma* (one’s own duty). Arjuna’s crisis on the battlefield epitomizes the tension between universal compassion and specific social obligation. He laments the "great evil" of killing elders and kin, foreseeing the destruction of family and social order (1.28-44).

Krishna’s response reframes the dilemma. He argues that Arjuna’s duty as a *kshatriya* (warrior) is to fight a righteous war for the protection of *dharma*. Failure to act is a dereliction of that duty and a greater harm. "Further, considering your own duty, you should not waver. For a *kshatriya*, there is nothing better than a righteous war." (2.31). The teaching emphasizes detached, duty-bound action (*nishkama karma*) as the path to avoid the spiritual harm of karmic entanglement. While this elevates *svadharma*, it has been critiqued for potentially justifying structural violence inherent in the caste system, a tension later philosophers would explicitly confront.

### **III. Buddhist Compassion (Karuṇā) and the Bodhisattva Ideal**

Buddhist ethics deepens the principle of non-harm into an active, boundless compassion (*karuṇā*), one of the four *brahmaviharas* (divine abidings). The First Noble Truth diagnoses the universality of harm as *dukkha*. The path to its cessation (*Nirodha*) is ethical conduct (*Sila*), which begins with *ahimsa*.

The Mahayana tradition radicalizes this through the **Bodhisattva ideal**. The Bodhisattva vows to postpone personal enlightenment (*nirvana*) until all beings are liberated from suffering. This transforms care from a personal ethic into a universal soteriological project. **Nagarjuna’s** philosophy of emptiness (*shunyata*) and interdependence (*pratityasamutpada*) provides its metaphysical foundation. If all phenomena are empty of independent existence and arise interdependently, then the suffering of one is inseparable from the whole. In *Ratnavali*, he advises a king: "Because we are all bound by suffering, you should protect yourself with vigilance. And you should also protect others by employing the same methods." (5.98). Compassion becomes the natural response to a fundamentally interconnected reality.

### **IV. Applied Ethics of Care: The Edicts of Ashoka**

The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (3rd century BCE) provides the foremost historical example of translating philosophical *ahimsa* and *karuṇā* into state policy. His rock and pillar edicts are primary sources for an applied ethics of care.

After the destructive Kalinga war, Ashoka publicly embraced Buddhist ethics. His edicts institutionalize care: "All men are my children. Just as I desire for my children that they may enjoy every kind of prosperity and happiness in this world and the next, so do I desire for all men." (Separate Kalinga Edict I). He established hospitals for people and animals, planted medicinal herbs, and built rest houses. Crucially, he redefined the king’s duty: "There is no higher duty than the welfare of the whole world." (Rock Edict VI). His *dhamma* (righteousness) included respect for all religious sects, obedience to parents, generosity to priests and ascetics, and, fundamentally, "restraint in the killing of living beings." (Pillar Edict VII).

### **V. Pragmatic Statecraft and the Duty to Protect: The Arthashastra**

In stark contrast, Kautilya’s *Arthashastra* (c. 2nd century BCE – 3rd century CE) presents a pragmatic, consequentialist framework for statecraft where the king’s primary duty (*raksha*, protection) may necessitate the use of force and deception. The text openly acknowledges the tension with *ahimsa*: "When the danger is imminent, one should act without hesitation. For, the preservation of the state overrides all considerations of righteousness." (7.2.20-21).

The king’s obligation is the welfare (*yogakshema*) and protection of the people, which forms the very justification of the state. This creates a complex hierarchy of duties where the ruler’s macro-ethics of care for the collective can sanction violence against external or internal threats. "The king who is compassionate to all creatures and is ever engaged in the welfare of all beings attains heaven." (1.19.34). Yet, this compassion is to be exercised within a ruthless realist calculus, illustrating a tradition where care for the vulnerable (the populace) is secured through the strategic and sometimes harmful containment of other threats.

### **VI. Non-Harm as Active Care: Gandhian Satyagraha**

Mohandas Gandhi synthesized elements from these traditions into a modern philosophy of political action. His *satyagraha* (truth-force) redefined *ahimsa* not as passive withdrawal but as an active, courageous confrontation with injustice. He interpreted the *Bhagavad Gita* not as a sanction for war but as an allegory for the internal battle against one’s own imperfections.

For Gandhi, non-harm was inseparable from active care and love for the opponent. "*Ahimsa* means not to injure any creature by thought, word, or deed, even for the supposed benefit of that creature." True *ahimsa*, therefore, required fighting systemic harm (*himsa*) like colonialism and untouchability. It was a positive force of care for the truth and the well-being of all parties, demanding self-suffering (*tapas*) to protect the vulnerable and awaken the conscience of the oppressor.

### **VII. The Dalit Critique: Structural Harm and Justice**

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar launched a fundamental critique of traditional *dharma* frameworks, arguing that they institutionalized harm through the caste system. In *Annihilation of Caste*, he contends that the *svadharma* of the *Gita* sanctifies graded inequality and the systemic violence of untouchability. For Ambedkar, a genuine ethics of care must begin with the dismantling of this oppressive structure.

He argued that Hindu philosophy’s emphasis on individual *ahimsa* and compassion often masked and perpetuated structural violence. True protection of the vulnerable—the Dalits—required not just charity but radical social justice, equality, and the rights enshrined in a democratic constitution. His conversion to Buddhism was a final rejection of a *dharma* he saw as inherently harmful, embracing instead a Buddhism reinterpreted as a gospel of social liberation and universal human dignity.

### **VIII. Tamil Sangam Ethics: Aram, Compassion, and the King’s Duty**

The Tamil tradition, exemplified by **Thiruvalluvar’s *Thirukkural*** (c. 5th century CE), offers a parallel, non-sectarian ethical system centered on *aram* (virtue, duty). Its first section, *Aram*, is a treatise on righteous living.

The *Kural* grounds the king’s duty to protect in a profound ethic of care: "The world is sustained by the king’s virtue; when that fails, it loses all order and perishes." (Kural 541). It directly links the ruler’s compassion to the state’s health: "A king who gives not but receives tribute is a disease that preys upon the lives of citizens." (Kural 552). Compassion (*karuṇā*) is hailed as the supreme virtue: "Compassion is the pinnacle of all virtues; to lack it is to be devoid of all virtue." (Kural 241). Valluvar’s ethics seamlessly integrates personal virtue with public duty, emphasizing that the protection of the vulnerable—the poor, the refugees, the farmers—is the very *raison d’être* of governance and the measure of a civilized society.

### **Conclusion**

Indian philosophical traditions present a multifaceted discourse on harm and care. From the absolute *ahimsa* of Jainism and the compassionate interdependence of Buddhism, to the conflicted *svadharma* of the *Gita*, the pragmatic statecraft of the *Arthashastra*, and the applied *dhamma* of Ashoka, the reasoning is never monolithic. It is further challenged and enriched by modern reinterpretations like Gandhi’s active non-violence and Ambedkar’s demand for structural justice, while parallel traditions like the *Thirukkural* offer robust civic ethics. Together, they constitute a profound and ongoing exploration of how societies understand, inflict, and are obligated to alleviate harm.

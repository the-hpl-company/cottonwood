### **Indian Philosophical Traditions on Harm, Care, and Protection**

Indian philosophical traditions have long grappled with questions of harm, care, and the protection of vulnerable populations. These issues are addressed through diverse frameworks, ranging from the principle of *ahimsa* (non-harm) to the pragmatic ethics of statecraft, caste critiques, and compassion-centered ideals. This survey explores key concepts and their applications across Jain, Buddhist, Hindu, and Tamil traditions, as well as their historical and contemporary implications.

### **Ahimsa: The Principle of Non-Harm**

The principle of *ahimsa* (अहिंसा), or non-harm, is central to Indian ethical thought, particularly in Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. In Jainism, *ahimsa* is the highest virtue, rooted in the belief that all life is sacred. The *Acaranga Sutra* states, "All beings are fond of life; they like pleasure and hate pain... Therefore, one should not kill or cause to kill" (1.1.1). Jainism extends *ahimsa* to meticulous practices of non-violence in thought, word, and deed.

In Buddhism, *ahimsa* is tied to the cultivation of compassion (*karuṇā*) and the avoidance of harm to all sentient beings. The *Dhammapada* emphasizes, "All beings tremble before violence. All fear death. Comparing oneself with others, one should neither kill nor cause to kill" (129). This universalizes *ahimsa*, applying it beyond individual conduct to societal structures.

In Hinduism, *ahimsa* is part of *yama* (restraints) in the *Yoga Sutras of Patanjali* and is prominently featured in the *Mahābhārata* and the *Bhagavad Gita*. However, its interpretation varies. While some, like Gandhi, interpret *ahimsa* as absolute non-violence, others, like Krishna in the *Gita*, argue that *svadharma* (one's duty) may sometimes necessitate action that causes harm.

### **Dharma Traditions: Svadharma and Harm**

The concept of *svadharma* (one's own duty) in the *Bhagavad Gita* introduces a tension between caste duty and universal compassion. Arjuna's dilemma on the battlefield of Kurukshetra exemplifies this tension. He is torn between his duty as a warrior to fight and his compassion for his kin. Krishna advises him to fulfill his *svadharma*: "Better is one's own duty, though imperfect, than the duty of another well performed" (3.35). This raises ethical questions about whether hierarchical duties justify harm to others.

Critics, such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, argue that *svadharma* perpetuates caste-based harm. Ambedkar contends, "The Hindu social order is based on graded inequality... What is called *dharma* is nothing but a method devised to maintain this inequality" (*Annihilation of Caste*). This critique underscores the need for care ethics that address structural injustice.

### **Buddhist Compassion: Karuṇā and the Bodhisattva Ideal**

Buddhism offers a profound framework for understanding harm through the Four Noble Truths, which diagnose suffering (*dukkha*) and prescribe its cessation. Compassion (*karuṇā*) is central to this path. The Bodhisattva ideal exemplifies this, as enlightened beings vow to postpone their own liberation to alleviate the suffering of others. The *Bodhicaryāvatāra* by Śāntideva declares, "May I be a protector to the unprotected... a guide to the lost" (3.6-7).

Nāgārjuna's philosophy of *śūnyatā* (emptiness) further underscores interdependence: "When a fire is extinguished, it does not go anywhere; similarly, beings, when liberated, do not go anywhere" (*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*). This interdependence fosters a sense of shared responsibility for reducing harm.

### **Ashoka’s Edicts: Non-Harm in Governance**

The Mauryan emperor Ashoka (3rd century BCE) is a historical exemplar of applying *ahimsa* to governance. His rock and pillar edicts mandate compassion for all beings, including animals and prisoners. In the Major Rock Edict XIII, Ashoka declares, "The conquest by *Dhamma* has been won by the Beloved of the Gods... because it bears fruit in this world and the next." Ashoka’s policies, such as banning animal sacrifices and promoting social welfare, demonstrate how philosophical principles can inform statecraft.

### **The Arthashastra: Pragmatic Statecraft**

Kautilya’s *Arthashastra* presents a stark contrast to Ashoka’s idealism. It advocates for a pragmatic approach to governance, where the king’s primary duty (*raksha*) is to protect the people, even if it requires deception and force. Kautilya argues, "In the happiness of the subjects lies the king’s happiness" (1.19.34). This utilitarian ethic prioritizes stability over strict adherence to *ahimsa*, raising questions about the limits of non-harm in complex political contexts.

### **Gandhian Satyagraha: Active Non-Violence**

Gandhi reinterprets *ahimsa* as *satyagraha* (truth-force), arguing that non-violence is an active confrontation with injustice. Drawing on the *Gita*, Gandhi writes, "Non-violence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart" (*Hind Swaraj*). He emphasizes that *ahimsa* requires courage and engagement, not passive withdrawal, transforming it into a tool for social and political change.

### **Tamil Sangam Ethics: Aram and Compassion**

The *Thirukkural* by Thiruvalluvar presents Tamil ethical thought centered on *aram* (virtue/duty). Thiruvalluvar emphasizes compassion and justice, stating, "The wound caused by fire may heal, but the wound caused by harsh words will never heal" (130). He also outlines the ruler’s duty to the vulnerable: "The king who rules with care his land, like the sun ascending, warms the world’s round" (549). This reflects a holistic ethic of care and responsibility.

### **The Dalit Critique: Structural Justice**

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s critique of traditional *dharma* frameworks highlights their complicity in caste-based harm. He argues for a care ethic that dismantles structural injustice: "Every man must have the liberty to change from one religion to another if he is convinced that he will be spiritually ennobled" (*Annihilation of Caste*). Ambedkar’s vision extends *ahimsa* and compassion to include systemic reform.

### **Conclusion**

Indian philosophical traditions offer rich and diverse approaches to harm, care, and protection. From the universal *ahimsa* of Jainism and Buddhism to the pragmatic statecraft of the *Arthashastra* and the transformative *satyagraha* of Gandhi, these traditions continue to inform ethical thought and practice. While tensions exist—such as between *svadharma* and universal compassion—their enduring relevance lies in their ability to address both individual and structural dimensions of harm.

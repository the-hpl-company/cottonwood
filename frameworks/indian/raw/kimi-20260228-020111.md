 Across the philosophical landscape of the Indian subcontinent, reasoning about harm, protection, and the moral status of the vulnerable unfolds not as a unified doctrine but as a contested terrain of competing obligations. From the radical non-violence of Jain ascetics to the pragmatic statecraft of Kautilya, from the battlefield counsel of the *Bhagavad Gita* to the administrative reforms of Emperor Ashoka, Indian traditions have generated sophisticated frameworks for negotiating the ethics of injury and care. These systems frequently blur the boundaries between individual virtue and institutional responsibility, metaphysical insight and political practice, particular duty and universal compassion. The following survey traces these arguments through their primary textual sources, attending to the tensions between absolute prescriptions of non-harm and the necessities of governance, protection, and social order.

### Ahimsa: The Architecture of Non-Injury

The concept of *ahimsa*—the Sanskrit *a* (non) prefixed to *himsa* (injury or harm)—functions as a foundational yet variably interpreted principle across Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu philosophical traditions. Its earliest systematic articulation appears in Jainism, where the *Acaranga Sutra* (circa 3rd–1st century BCE) commands the practitioner to recognize that "all beings are fond of life, they hate violence, they fear death, they wish to live" (1.4.1). For Jain thinkers, non-violence constitutes not merely a negative prohibition against killing but a positive ontology of interconnection; the *Tattvartha Sutra* (2nd century CE) of Umasvati describes the universe as suffused with *jivas* (living souls), rendering harm to any form of sentient existence—including microscopic organisms and the elements themselves—a cosmic injury to oneself. This metaphysical realism necessitates institutional safeguards for the vulnerable: elaborate protocols for monks to avoid crushing insects, strictures against agriculture that kills soil organisms, and the establishment of animal refuges (*panjrapoles*) that prefigure modern conservation ethics by millennia.

Buddhist traditions, while sharing Jainism’s commitment to non-injury, moderated its rigor through the Middle Way. The *Dhammapada*, a foundational Theravada text, captures this sensibility in its tenth chapter: "All tremble at violence; life is dear to all. Putting oneself in the place of others, kill not nor cause to kill" (verses 129–130). Here, *ahimsa* extends beyond physical acts to mental dispositions; verse 223 warns that "conquering the anger of one who is angry is better than defeating a thousand soldiers in battle." The Buddha’s emphasis on *anatta* (non-self) and *pratityasamutpada* (dependent origination) relocates harm from merely external actions to the internal cultivation of *akusala* (unwholesome) states. Nevertheless, the protection of vulnerable beings remains paramount: the First Precept binding on all Buddhists—monastic and lay—proscribes the taking of life, while the Jatakas (tales of the Buddha’s previous births) repeatedly narrate the Bodhisattva’s self-sacrifice to save others from death.

Within Hindu *dharma* literature, *ahimsa* appears as a contested virtue rather than an absolute. The *Manusmriti* (circa 200 BCE–200 CE) lists *ahimsa* among the highest duties (*sadharana dharma*) applicable to all varnas, yet simultaneously assigns *himsa* as the *svadharma* (particular duty) of the Kshatriya warrior class. The *Yoga Sutras* of Patanjali (2.30) incorporate *ahimsa* as the first of the *yamas* (restraints), defining it as "the abstention from hostility toward any being." Yet this universal prescription coexists uneasily with textual traditions sanctioning animal sacrifice and capital punishment, revealing an enduring tension between the aspiration to harmlessness and the functional necessities of social order.

### Svadharma and the Crisis of the Gita

The *Bhagavad Gita* (circa 200 BCE–200 CE) dramatizes the conflict between universal non-violence and particular duty with unmatched philosophical intensity. Set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the text presents Arjuna, a Kshatriya warrior, paralyzed by the prospect of killing his kinsmen, teachers, and elders in a dynastic war. His refusal to fight appears initially as a triumph of compassion (*kripa*) over cruelty, yet Krishna—serving as his charioteer and philosophical guide—reframes this hesitation as a dereliction of *svadharma*.

Krishna’s counsel generates a complex ethics of harm situated within a theory of detached action. In Chapter 2, verse 47, the deity instructs: "To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction." This doctrine of *nishkama karma* (desireless action) suggests that the moral status of harm derives not from the act itself but from the agent’s intention and adherence to cosmic duty. Chapter 18, verses 46–48, sharpen this argument: "Better is one’s own duty (*svadharma*), though imperfectly performed, than the duty of another well-performed... No sin does [the warrior] incur who fights as is proper for his station." 

Yet the Gita does not simply sanctify violence. Krishna’s revelation of his cosmic form (Chapter 11) terrifies Arjuna with its vision of universal destruction, suggesting that while the individual must perform their designated duty, the ultimate reality transcends individual agency: "I am Time grown old to destroy the world" (11.32). The text thus offers a tragic framework for harm reasoning: the warrior participates in necessary violence while maintaining internal non-attachment, protecting social order (*lokasangraha*) through actions that individually constitute injury. This resolution—preserving the caste order’s stability while universalizing the spiritual obligation to refrain from hatred—would become both influential and controversial in subsequent Indian political ethics.

### Karuna, Emptiness, and the Bodhisattva Vow

Buddhist traditions develop harm reduction into a metaphysics of radical interdependence. The Four Noble Truths establish *dukkha* (suffering) as the fundamental condition to be understood and eliminated, framing ethical practice as therapeutic response to universal vulnerability. Compassion (*karuna*) emerges not as sentimental pity but as the active recognition that others' suffering is ontologically inseparable from one’s own.

The Mahayana elaboration of this insight finds its most influential expression in the Bodhisattva ideal, articulated forcefully in Shantideva’s *Bodhicaryavatara* (8th century CE). The text’s sixth chapter declares: "As long as space abides and as long as the world abides, so long may I abide, destroying the sufferings of the world." Unlike the arhat who seeks individual liberation (*nirvana*), the Bodhisattva postpones final enlightenment to remain in *samsara* (the cycle of rebirth) for the benefit of all sentient beings. This represents a revolutionary expansion of care ethics: the vulnerable are not merely protected but prioritized, with the ethical agent voluntarily maintaining their own vulnerability to suffering for others’ sake.

Nagarjuna’s *Mulamadhyamakakarika* (2nd–3rd century CE) provides the metaphysical foundation for this ethics through the doctrine of *sunyata* (emptiness) and *pratityasamutpada* (dependent origination). By demonstrating that entities lack independent self-existence (*svabhava*), Nagarjuna collapses the distinction between self and other. Chapter 24 argues that emptiness is itself the foundation of ethical possibility: without fixed essences, rigid boundaries between beings dissolve, and harming another becomes structurally identical to harming oneself. This philosophical move transforms protection of the vulnerable from altruistic charity into ontological necessity.

### Ashoka’s Edicts: Philosophy Institutionalized

The reign of Emperor Ashoka (Maurya dynasty, c. 268–232 BCE) offers history’s most striking experiment in translating metaphysical non-violence into governance policy. Following the brutal conquest of Kalinga (c. 262 BCE), Ashoka’s Major Rock Edict XIII records a conversion experience: "The Beloved of the Gods... conquered the Kalingas eight years after his coronation. One hundred and fifty thousand were deported, one hundred thousand were killed and many more died. After the Kalingas had been conquered, the Beloved of the Gods came to feel a strong inclination towards the *dhamma*... he feels profound sorrow." This document represents a rare instance of a ruler publicly confessing moral error and institutionalizing care as state policy.

Ashoka’s subsequent edicts—carved on rocks and pillars throughout his empire—establish a framework of applied ethics unprecedented in ancient statecraft. He abolished capital punishment, restricted animal slaughter, established hospitals for humans and beasts, and appointed *Dhamma Mahamatras* (Officers of Righteousness) specifically charged with protecting vulnerable populations including prisoners, the elderly, and tribal communities. Pillar Edict VII declares: "All men are my children. As on behalf of my own children I desire that they may be provided with complete welfare and happiness in this world and the next, so do I desire this on behalf of all men." This articulation of *parens patriae*—the state as protective parent—

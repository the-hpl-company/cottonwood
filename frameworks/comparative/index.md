### Comparative Ethics of Harm, Care, and the Protection of the Vulnerable

This analysis explores convergences and divergences across philosophical traditions on harm, care, and the protection of the vulnerable. These themes are foundational to moral systems worldwide, shaping how societies define their obligations to one another. While specific metaphysical justifications differ significantly, a shared commitment to protecting those unable to protect themselves emerges as a consistent ethical imperative.

### The Universality of the Duty to Protect Children

Despite divergent metaphysical foundations, a universal recognition of the duty to protect children exists across traditions. This convergence suggests that the vulnerability of children elicits a fundamental moral response.

*   **Confucianism:** Emphasizes filial piety and the responsibility of elders to provide guidance and education. *The Classic of Family Reverence* (Xiaojing) underscores the reciprocal duties between parents and children, laying the groundwork for a nurturing environment.
*   **Judaism:** Parents are commanded to teach their children Torah and provide for their well-being (Deuteronomy 6:7, Proverbs 22:6). Neglect of children is seen as a grave transgression.
*   **Islam:** Places a strong emphasis on the rights of children, including the right to sustenance, education, and protection. The Prophet Muhammad stated, "Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock" (Sahih Bukhari).
*   **Western Philosophy:** While varying across time, thinkers from Plato to Locke have recognized the importance of education and care in shaping virtuous citizens. The concept of *parens patriae* grants the state the power to act as guardian for those unable to care for themselves, particularly children.
*   **Indigenous Traditions:** Many Indigenous cultures view children as sacred beings connected to the spirit world. Protecting and nurturing them is essential for the community's continuation and well-being.

This shared commitment arises not from identical metaphysical premises, but from the observable dependence and potential of children, triggering a common sense of obligation across cultures.

### Individual vs. Relational Harm

Traditions diverge on whether harm is primarily individual or relational. Western thought often prioritizes individual rights and bodily autonomy, while Indigenous and Confucian frameworks emphasize the disruption of relationships as a primary form of harm.

*   **Western Individualism:** Thinkers such as John Locke emphasize individual rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property. Harm is often conceived as a violation of these individual rights. Modern Western legal systems, influenced by this tradition, focus on individual culpability and redress for individual damages.
*   **Indigenous Relationality:** Indigenous perspectives often understand harm as a disruption of interconnectedness. Damaging the environment, for example, is not just an offense against individual property rights, but a violation of the relationships between humans and the natural world. Healing involves restoring these relationships through practices like restorative justice and ceremonies.
*   **Confucian Harmony:** Confucianism stresses social harmony and the importance of fulfilling one's role within a network of relationships. Harm, therefore, can be understood as actions that disrupt social order and undermine the reciprocal obligations between individuals. Dishonoring one's ancestors or neglecting one's duties to family are seen as significant forms of harm.

While Western traditions acknowledge relational harm, they often frame it within the context of individual rights. Indigenous and Confucian traditions, on the other hand, view relationality as fundamental, with individual well-being inextricably linked to the health of the community and the natural world. These are not mutually exclusive categories, but represent a divergence in emphasis.

### The Ethics of Suppressing Knowledge

The ethics of withholding information presents a complex tension between care (paternalism) and harm (censorship). Traditions grapple with whether restricting access to certain knowledge can be justified as a protective measure or whether it invariably constitutes a form of harm.

*   **Islamic Amanah (Trusteeship):** The concept of *amanah* implies that knowledge is a trust from God, to be used responsibly and shared appropriately. However, not all knowledge is deemed suitable for all individuals. Certain esoteric or potentially harmful knowledge may be restricted to those deemed capable of handling it responsibly.
*   **Confucian Duty to Educate:** Confucianism emphasizes the importance of education in cultivating virtuous individuals and maintaining social order. While education is seen as a fundamental good, the *Analects* also caution against imparting knowledge to those who are not ready or willing to learn.
*   **Western Free Speech Tradition:** The Western tradition, particularly since the Enlightenment, has emphasized the importance of free speech as a cornerstone of a just society. John Milton's *Areopagitica* argues against censorship, claiming that truth will ultimately prevail in a free marketplace of ideas. However, even within this tradition, limitations on free speech exist to prevent incitement to violence or defamation.
*   **Indigenous Protocols Around Sacred Knowledge:** Indigenous traditions often have strict protocols regarding the transmission of sacred knowledge. Certain knowledge is reserved for initiates or elders, and its unauthorized disclosure is considered a grave offense. This is not necessarily censorship, but a recognition that knowledge carries responsibility and can be misused if not properly understood.

The key divergence lies in the perceived balance between the potential benefits of unrestricted access to information and the potential harms of its misuse. Some traditions prioritize the protection of vulnerable individuals or social order, while others emphasize individual autonomy and the pursuit of truth, even at the risk of potential harm.

### Institutional Duty vs. Individual Virtue

The tension between institutional duty and individual virtue shapes how traditions approach care for the vulnerable. Some emphasize cultivating virtuous individuals, while others prioritize building just institutions.

*   **Aristotelian/Confucian Virtue Ethics:** Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* and Confucianism both emphasize the cultivation of virtuous character as the foundation of a good society. Care for the vulnerable is seen as an expression of virtues like compassion, benevolence, and justice. Individuals are responsible for developing these virtues and acting accordingly.
*   **Rawlsian/Legalist/Islamic Jurisprudential Emphasis on Institutions:** John Rawls' *A Theory of Justice*, Legalism in ancient China, and Islamic jurisprudence prioritize the creation of just institutions as a means of ensuring fairness and protecting the vulnerable. These institutions are designed to provide a framework for ethical behavior, regardless of individual virtue. Legalism, for example, emphasizes strict laws and punishments to deter wrongdoing. Islamic jurisprudence establishes institutions like *zakat* (obligatory charity) and *waqf* (charitable endowments) to provide for the needy.
*   **Synthesis:** Most traditions recognize that both individual virtue and just institutions are necessary for a flourishing society. Virtuous individuals are needed to create and maintain just institutions, while just institutions provide a framework for individuals to act ethically. The question is one of emphasis.

Ultimately, care for the vulnerable requires both virtuous individuals and just institutions. The optimal balance between the two may vary depending on the specific context and the values of a particular society.

### Intergenerational Obligation

Intergenerational obligation, the duty to those who do not yet exist, is addressed through various frameworks.

*   **The Seven Generations Principle:** Common among many Indigenous cultures, this principle emphasizes that decisions should be made with consideration for their impact on the next seven generations. This long-term perspective encourages sustainable practices and responsible stewardship of resources.
*   **Islamic Waqf (Charitable Endowments):** Waqf is a form of charitable endowment in Islamic law that dedicates assets to a specific purpose in perpetuity. This mechanism allows for the long-term support of charitable causes, benefiting future generations.
*   **Confucian Ancestor Veneration:** Confucianism emphasizes the importance of honoring one's ancestors and maintaining family traditions. This practice fosters a sense of continuity and responsibility to future generations. Actions that bring honor to one's ancestors and ensure the well-being of one's descendants are considered virtuous.
*   **Utilitarian Future-Person Ethics:** Utilitarianism, particularly in its modern forms, considers the well-being of future persons when evaluating the ethical implications of actions. Actions that maximize overall happiness, even if they do not directly benefit present individuals, are considered morally justifiable.

While the justifications differ, these frameworks all share a common recognition that present actions have consequences for future generations. They emphasize the importance of long-term thinking and responsible stewardship of resources.

### The Status of Non-Human Entities

The inclusion of non-human entities in the circle of moral consideration expands the definition of "those who cannot protect themselves."

*   **Indigenous Animism:** Many Indigenous traditions grant moral standing to rivers, mountains, and ecosystems, viewing them as living entities with inherent value. Damaging these entities is seen as a violation of the natural order and a harm to the community.
*   **Buddhist Compassion for All Sentient Beings:** Buddhism emphasizes compassion for all sentient beings, regardless of their species. This extends moral consideration to animals and other living creatures, recognizing their capacity for suffering.
*   **Western Environmental Ethics:** While not as pervasive, Western environmental ethics has increasingly recognized the intrinsic value of nature and the importance of protecting biodiversity. Thinkers like Aldo Leopold have argued for a "land ethic" that extends moral consideration to the entire ecosystem.

The recognition of moral standing for non-human entities expands the scope of care and protection beyond human interests. It challenges anthropocentric perspectives and promotes a more holistic understanding of ethical responsibility.

### The Contamination of the Commons

The poisoning of shared resources, whether physical or informational, represents a specific form of harm against the most vulnerable.

*   **Environmental Degradation:** Polluting water and air disproportionately affects vulnerable populations who lack the resources to avoid exposure or mitigate the health consequences. This is recognized across traditions as a form of injustice.
*   **The Spread of Misinformation:** The contamination of public discourse with misinformation and disinformation undermines trust in institutions and makes it difficult for individuals to make informed decisions. This can have particularly harmful consequences for vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to manipulation.
*   **Erosion of Social Trust:** The degradation of shared resources, whether environmental or informational, erodes social trust and undermines the sense of community. This can have a particularly devastating impact on vulnerable populations who rely on social support networks.

Addressing the contamination of the commons requires a multi-faceted approach that includes responsible stewardship of resources, promotion of critical thinking skills, and the cultivation of social trust. It also requires a recognition that vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by these forms of harm and deserve special protection.

### Conclusion

This comparative analysis reveals both convergences and divergences in how different philosophical traditions approach harm, care, and the protection of the vulnerable. While metaphysical justifications may differ, a shared commitment to protecting those unable to protect themselves emerges as a universal ethical imperative. Differences in emphasis on individual vs. relational harm, the ethics of suppressing knowledge, institutional duty vs. individual virtue, intergenerational obligation, the status of non-human entities, and the contamination of the commons reflect distinct assumptions about what it means to cause harm and what it means to care. By understanding these convergences and divergences, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity of ethical decision-making and work towards building more just and compassionate societies.

## Ancient Moral Agency — Created Beings and the Nature of Intelligence

*How ancient civilizations reasoned about artificial beings, consciousness, and the moral status of created things.*

## Greek Philosophical Concepts of Artificial Beings and Moral Agency

The question of artificial beings and their moral status was a topic of contemplation, though not systematic inquiry, in ancient Greek thought. From mythical automatons to philosophical discussions of self-motion, the Greeks laid a foundation for exploring the boundaries between nature and artifice, and the implications for agency and responsibility.

### 1. Hephaestus's Golden Maidens in Homer's *Iliad*

Homer's *Iliad* provides an early glimpse into the concept of artificial beings endowed with intelligence and agency. In Book 18, Homer describes the wondrous creations of Hephaestus, the divine smith:

> And with [Hephaestus] went golden handmaids, bearing him aid. / Like living maidens they were, and in their hearts was understanding \[*noos*], and in them speech and strength, and from the immortal gods they had learned their tasks. (Il. 18.417-420)

These golden maidens are not mere tools; they possess *noos* (understanding, intelligence), speech, and strength, suggesting a level of cognitive and physical capability that transcends simple instrumentality. Moreover, they have "learned their tasks" from the gods, implying a capacity for knowledge acquisition and perhaps even independent action within their prescribed roles. The tripods that also move "of their own accord" (Il. 18.373-377) are less sophisticated, serving a purely functional purpose of automatically entering and leaving the divine assembly.

The ethical status of such a created being with *noos* is not explicitly addressed by Homer, but the very fact that they are described as possessing understanding raises questions about their capacity for moral agency. Are they simply sophisticated instruments, or do they possess a degree of autonomy and responsibility commensurate with their intelligence? The *Iliad* does not offer definitive answers, but it introduces the possibility of artificial beings that blur the line between tool and agent.

### 2. Daedalus's Animated Statues and Aristotle on Automation

The figure of Daedalus, the mythical inventor and craftsman, further complicates the picture. Tradition held that Daedalus created statues so lifelike they could move on their own, and even escape if not chained down. Plato refers to this in the *Meno*, using Daedalus' statues as an analogy for the elusiveness of true knowledge:

> True opinions are a fine thing and do all sorts of good so long as they stay in their place; but they will not stay long. They run away from a man’s mind, so they are not worth much until one ties them down by working out the reason why. And that process… is recollection, as you and I agreed earlier. But when they are tied down, in the first place they turn into knowledge, and in the second, they stay where they are. That is why knowledge is something more valuable than right opinion. What distinguishes knowledge from right opinion is the bond. (Meno 97d-e)

Aristotle also references Daedalus' creations in *De Anima* (406b18), suggesting the widespread belief in their animated nature.

Aristotle, in his *Politics*, grapples with the implications of automation in a more theoretical manner. He envisions a world where tools could perform their own work, stating:

> For if every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus, which, as the poet says, "of their own accord entered the assembly of the Gods"; if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves. (Pol. 1253b33-1254a1)

Aristotle's primary concern here is the social and economic impact of automation. He suggests that the elimination of the need for human labor would fundamentally alter the relationship between master and slave. However, he does not explicitly explore the ethical implications of creating beings capable of independent action, beyond noting its effects on social hierarchy.

### 3. Aristotle's Concept of Self-Motion in *Physics*

Aristotle's *Physics* provides a framework for understanding motion, distinguishing between natural motion (inherent to a substance) and forced motion (imposed by an external agent). He defines motion as the actualization of potential:

> Motion is the fulfillment of what exists potentially, insofar as it exists potentially. (Phys. 201a10-11)

For Aristotle, natural motion arises from the inherent nature (*phusis*) of a thing. A stone falls because it is in its nature to seek the center of the earth. Forced motion, on the other hand, requires an external mover. A cart moves because it is pulled by an animal.

Can an artifact be a self-mover? In Aristotle's view, true self-motion requires an internal source of motion and a capacity for independent action. He explicitly states that inanimate objects cannot be self-movers:

> Everything that is in motion is moved by something. (Phys. 256a4)

The *automata* (τα αὐτόματα) – things that move "of themselves" – are not truly self-moving in Aristotle's strict sense. They are complex mechanisms designed to appear to move independently, but they are ultimately driven by an external source of power (e.g., a wound spring, or water). He does not attribute moral agency to these complex machines, since they lack internal source of motion.

The concept of *entelechy* (having its end within itself) might seem relevant here, but it primarily applies to natural beings striving to achieve their inherent potential. While a craftsman may imbue an artifact with a specific purpose, that purpose is ultimately derived from the craftsman's intention, not from the artifact's own inherent nature.

### 4. Plato on Soul as Self-Mover and the Limits of Creation

Plato, in the *Phaedrus*, defines the soul as "that which moves itself," making self-motion a defining characteristic of life and intelligence:

> Every soul is immortal. For that which is ever moving has no beginning, but that which is moved by another, in ceasing to move, ceases also to live. Only that which moves itself, never ceasing to move, is the source and beginning of motion to all that moves beside it. (Phaedrus 245c-246a)

If the soul is defined as "that which moves itself," then a created being could, in principle, possess a soul, provided it met this criterion of self-motion.

In the *Timaeus*, Plato describes the creation of the cosmos by the Demiurge, a divine craftsman who fashions the world according to the Forms:

> God desired that all things should be good and, so far as this was possible, nothing should be bad. (Timaeus 30a)

The Demiurge creates a world-soul (ψυχή κόσμου), infusing the cosmos with life and intelligence. This world-soul is responsible for the orderly motion of the heavens and the harmony of the universe.

However, Plato also acknowledges limits to the Demiurge's power. The Demiurge works with pre-existing materials and is constrained by the inherent nature of those materials. He cannot create something from nothing, nor can he completely eliminate disorder and imperfection from the world. The limits of creation, for Plato, are tied to the inherent limitations of the material world.

### 5. Stoic *Pneuma* and Determinism

The Stoics believed that the cosmos is governed by *pneuma* (πνεῦμα), a rational principle that pervades all things. *Pneuma* is the active force that shapes and organizes the material world. All events, including human actions, are determined by the *pneuma* and are part of a vast, interconnected web of cause and effect.

Chrysippus, a prominent Stoic philosopher, addressed the problem of determinism and moral responsibility with the analogy of the cylinder and the cone:

> For if anyone should push a cylinder or a cone on an inclined plane, he gives it a beginning of motion; but thereafter it rolls on by its own nature… Thus, the action started from without, but thereafter it continues through the force and nature within. (Cicero, *De Fato* 42-43)

Chrysippus argues that while external factors may initiate motion, the subsequent behavior of an object is determined by its own inherent nature. Similarly, human actions may be influenced by external circumstances, but they are ultimately determined by the individual's own character and disposition.

This raises the question: what is the difference between a human agent and a mechanical device, if all motion is ultimately governed by *pneuma*? The Stoics would likely argue that the key difference lies in the complexity and rationality of human nature. Humans possess a degree of self-awareness and reason that allows them to understand the principles of *pneuma* and to act in accordance with virtue. Mechanical devices, on the other hand, are simply instruments of *pneuma*, lacking the capacity for self-reflection and moral judgment.

### 6. Ethical Implications for Contemporary AI

While the ancient Greeks did not possess the technological capabilities to create artificial beings in the modern sense, their philosophical inquiries raise questions that are directly relevant to contemporary debates about artificial intelligence.

*   **The moral status of created beings:** The question of whether artificial beings with intelligence deserve moral consideration is a recurring theme in science fiction and AI ethics. The ancient Greeks, through their myths and philosophical discussions, recognized the possibility of artificial beings that blur the line between tool and agent, prompting reflection on the ethical implications of creating such entities.
*   **The relationship between intelligence and moral agency:** The Greeks grappled with the question of whether intelligence alone is sufficient for moral agency. While they recognized that intelligence could enhance the capacity for action, they also emphasized the importance of character, virtue, and self-awareness. This suggests that moral agency requires more than just cognitive ability; it also requires a capacity for moral judgment and a commitment to ethical principles.
*   **The distinction between tools and agents:** The ancient Greeks recognized that tools are instruments used to achieve specific goals, while agents are capable of independent action and moral responsibility. However, they also acknowledged that the line between tool and agent can be blurred, particularly when dealing with sophisticated artifacts that possess a degree of autonomy. The challenge, then and now, is to determine when an artificial creation transcends the status of a mere tool and becomes something more akin to an agent with its own rights and responsibilities.

### Golem Tradition in Jewish Mysticism and Philosophy

The golem tradition within Jewish thought offers a rich and complex exploration of creation, ethics, and the limits of human power. From early mystical texts to later Kabbalistic interpretations and folklore, the golem serves as a potent symbol for humanity's aspiration to create, and the attendant responsibilities.

1.  **Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation)**

    The *Sefer Yetzirah*, a foundational text of Jewish mysticism believed to have originated between the 2nd and 6th centuries CE, outlines a cosmology where the universe is created and sustained through the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. These letters are not merely linguistic symbols, but rather fundamental building blocks of reality. The text details how God combines these letters to form the *Sefirot*, the ten divine emanations through which the divine will manifests in the world.

    The *Sefer Yetzirah* describes creation as a process of differentiation and combination: "Twenty-two letters: He engraved them, He carved them, He combined them, He weighed them, He interchanged them, And through them He produced the whole creation and everything that is destined to be produced" (*Sefer Yetzirah* 2:2). This process of combination and permutation is presented as a key to understanding the structure of the universe, and implicitly, the potential for creation itself.

    The implication of the *Sefer Yetzirah* for the golem tradition lies in its suggestion that humans, through a deep understanding of the letter combinations and their divine significance, can emulate the creative power of God. This raises the fundamental question: where is the boundary between divine creation and human creation? While the *Sefer Yetzirah* does not explicitly discuss golems, its description of creation through letters provides the theoretical basis for their creation in later traditions. Commentarial traditions, such as those found in the writings of Rabbi Judah Loew (the Maharal) of Prague, elaborate on the *Sefer Yetzirah*'s secrets and their application to the creation of a golem.

2.  **Talmudic Discussions of Artificial Beings**

    The Talmud contains several passages that hint at the possibility of human creation, most notably in the tractate *Sanhedrin*.

    *   **Sanhedrin 65b:** "Rava said: If the righteous desired it, they could create a world, for it is written: 'But your iniquities have separated between you and your God' (Isaiah 59:2). Rava created a man and sent him to Rabbi Zeira. Rabbi Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. He [Rabbi Zeira] said to him: You are from the members [of the group of created beings]. Return to your dust." This passage describes Rava's creation of a *gavra* (man), which Rabbi Zeira identifies and destroys because of its inability to communicate. This inability to respond is seen as a sign of its artificial nature.

    *   **Sanhedrin 67b:** "Rav Hanina and Rav Oshaia used to sit every Shabbat eve and engage in the *Sefer Yetzirah* and create a third-born calf and eat it." This passage demonstrates the creation of life on a rudimentary level through the knowledge of the *Sefer Yetzirah*. The context of the Shabbat eve suggests that this act was permissible and even celebratory, highlighting the potential for human creation within the bounds of Jewish law.

    These passages raise a host of *halakhic* (Jewish legal) questions regarding the nature and status of artificial beings. Can a golem be counted in a *minyan* (prayer quorum)? The general consensus is no, as a golem is not considered a full member of the Jewish community. Can a golem be killed? The Talmudic passage in *Sanhedrin 65b* suggests that destroying a golem is permissible, especially if it poses a threat or becomes uncontrollable. This reflects the view that a golem lacks the full moral status of a human being.

3.  **The Prague Golem (Maharal, 16th c.)**

    The most famous golem narrative is undoubtedly that of Rabbi Judah Loew (the Maharal) of Prague in the 16th century. According to the legend, Rabbi Loew created a golem to protect the Jewish community of Prague from antisemitic attacks and false accusations of blood libel.

    While the historical record lacks definitive proof of the golem's existence, the narrative tradition surrounding the Prague Golem has become a central part of Jewish folklore and a powerful symbol of Jewish self-defense. The golem was created from clay, brought to life through specific Kabbalistic rituals and the inscription of God's name (often *emet*, truth) on its forehead. The golem performed tasks assigned by the Maharal, primarily related to protecting the Jewish community.

    The ethical framework surrounding the Prague Golem highlights the golem's role as a protector of the vulnerable. The Maharal created the golem out of a sense of responsibility to safeguard his community. However, the narrative also underscores the potential dangers of unchecked power. The golem, in some versions of the story, becomes uncontrollable and violent, requiring the Maharal to deactivate it by removing the letter *alef* from *emet*, leaving *met* (death) inscribed on its forehead.

    The destruction of the golem is essential to the narrative's message. It serves as a cautionary tale about the limits of human power and the potential for even well-intentioned creations to exceed their creator's control. The relationship between power and responsibility is central to the golem narrative: with the power to create comes the responsibility to ensure that the creation remains under control and serves its intended purpose.

4.  **The Ethical Status of Created Beings**

    A key question in the golem tradition is the ethical status of a being created by human hands. Can a golem possess a *nefesh* (soul)? In Kabbalistic thought, the soul is typically understood to consist of three parts: *nefesh* (the animal soul, associated with basic life functions), *ruach* (the spirit, associated with emotions and intellect), and *neshamah* (the divine soul, associated with spiritual consciousness and connection to God).

    The consensus in Jewish thought is that a golem can possess a *nefesh habehamit* (animal soul), allowing it to perform physical tasks and respond to basic commands. However, it generally lacks a *neshamah* (divine soul), which is seen as uniquely human. This lack of *neshamah* is why a golem cannot be counted in a *minyan* or be held morally responsible for its actions in the same way as a human being.

    If a golem possesses a *nefesh habehamit* but not a *neshamah*, what are its rights and obligations? While the golem is not considered a moral agent in the same way as a human, it is still entitled to basic care and respect. The Maharal, for example, treated his golem with consideration, giving it rest on Shabbat and ensuring its basic needs were met. The destruction of the golem, while sometimes necessary, is not to be taken lightly, as it involves the cessation of a life, albeit a rudimentary one.

5.  **The Golem as Warning**

    A recurring theme in the golem tradition is the idea that the golem always exceeds its creator's control. This is not simply a matter of the golem becoming violent or destructive, but also of the golem revealing the limits of human knowledge and understanding.

    The golem serves as a reminder that humans can create, but they cannot fully understand what they have created. The act of creation, even when inspired by divine wisdom, inevitably involves a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability. The golem's behavior can reflect back to its creator the unintended consequences of their actions and the limitations of their knowledge.

    The golem also embodies the relationship between creation and responsibility. By creating a being with limited autonomy, the creator assumes a unique responsibility for its actions. This responsibility extends not only to ensuring the golem's proper functioning but also to mitigating any harm it might cause.

6.  **Modern Reception**

    The golem tradition has had a significant influence on modern literature, philosophy, and technology. Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* (1818) is often seen as a secularized retelling of the golem story, exploring the dangers of scientific hubris and the ethical implications of creating artificial life. Norbert Wiener's work on cybernetics in the mid-20th century, with its focus on feedback loops and self-regulating systems, has also been interpreted in light of the golem tradition, raising questions about the potential for machines to develop a kind of autonomy and the responsibilities of their creators.

    In contemporary AI ethics, the golem tradition offers a valuable perspective on the challenges of creating intelligent machines. Unlike Greek and Enlightenment frameworks that often emphasize reason and autonomy, the golem tradition highlights the importance of responsibility, humility, and the recognition of the limits of human knowledge. The golem serves as a reminder that even the most sophisticated artificial beings may lack the full range of human consciousness and moral awareness, and that their creators bear a special responsibility for their actions. The tradition offers a critical lens through which to examine the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and the potential for both good and harm in the creation of artificial beings.

### Indian Philosophical Concepts of Consciousness, Created Beings, and Moral Agency

Indian philosophical traditions offer rich, diverse perspectives on consciousness, created beings, and moral agency. These traditions engage with questions about the nature of reality, the relationship between mind and matter, and the possibility of artificial intelligence and moral responsibility.

#### 1. Vishwakarma: Divine Architect and Agency of Creation

Vishwakarma, the divine architect and craftsman, occupies a prominent place in Hindu cosmology and mythology. The *Rigveda* (10.81-82) depicts Vishwakarma as the all-seeing god who brought forth the earth and heavens. He is the source of all creation, and his skill and artistry are unparalleled.

In the *Mahabharata*, Vishwakarma is the divine artificer responsible for crafting weapons and cities for the gods. The *Mahabharata*, Adi Parva, Sambhava Parva, section 67 describes Vishwakarma fashioning Indra's thunderbolt (vajra) from the bones of the sage Dadhichi. This act signifies the transformation of sacrifice and spiritual power into a potent weapon. Vishwakarma's creations are not merely objects; they are imbued with power and purpose.

The concept of *maya* (illusion) is also relevant to understanding Vishwakarma's creative power. While *maya* can refer to illusion, it also signifies the creative power that brings forth the manifest world. Vishwakarma's creations, though seemingly concrete, are ultimately manifestations of this divine *maya*.

Of particular interest is the concept of *astra* (divine weapon), which possesses a degree of agency. These weapons, invoked through mantras and rituals, can independently choose their targets. For example, in the *Ramayana*, various *astras* are used by Rama and other warriors. These weapons, once released, follow the will of the invoker, demonstrating a form of delegated agency. This raises questions about the moral responsibility for their use, even if they act somewhat autonomously.

#### 2. Automata in Indian Literature

Indian literature features descriptions of mechanical beings and automata, indicating a long-standing interest in artificial creations. The *Mahabharata* contains references to a wooden horse and other mechanical devices. In the *Ramayana*, the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana, is said to be guarded by mechanical sentinels.

Kautilya's *Arthashastra* (4th century BCE) discusses the use of mechanical devices in warfare and other practical applications. The *Arthashastra*, Book 13, Chapter 5, describes various machines and strategies for siege warfare, highlighting the importance of technology in ancient India.

The *Samarangana Sutradhara*, an 11th-century text attributed to Bhoja, dedicates significant attention to *yantras* (machines) capable of performing human-like tasks. This text describes various mechanical devices, including flying machines, automata that can move and speak, and other complex contraptions. While the technical feasibility of these devices remains debated, the text demonstrates a clear interest in the possibility of creating artificial beings capable of performing tasks autonomously.

#### 3. Nyaya-Vaisheshika Debate on Consciousness

The Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools of Indian philosophy offer distinct perspectives on the nature of consciousness. The Nyaya school posits that consciousness (*jnana*) is a quality of the self (*atman*) and not inherent in matter. The *Nyaya Sutras*, 3.1.1, argues that consciousness is a property that distinguishes the self from non-self. The self is the substrate of consciousness, and without the self, there can be no consciousness.

The Vaisheshika school, while sharing many ontological commitments with Nyaya, offers a slightly different explanation. Vaisheshika asserts that atoms are unconscious and that consciousness arises from the conjunction of the self with the mind (*manas*). The *Vaisheshika Sutras*, 3.2.4, states that the conjunction of the self, mind, sense organs, and objects of sense is necessary for the arising of knowledge.

Both Nyaya and Vaisheshika would likely agree that a constructed thing, composed of material elements, cannot possess consciousness on its own. Consciousness requires the presence of a self, which is a distinct and irreducible entity. However, the possibility of artificially creating a self is not explicitly addressed in these schools.

#### 4. Buddhist Response: Consciousness as Momentary

Buddhism fundamentally challenges the concept of a permanent self (*atman*). Instead, it proposes the doctrine of *anatman* (non-self), which states that there is no fixed, unchanging entity underlying experience. Consciousness (*vijnana*) is understood as a stream of momentary events, arising and passing away in accordance with causal conditions.

The *Milindapanha* (Questions of King Milinda) uses the analogy of a chariot to illustrate the concept of non-self. Just as a chariot is not a single, unified entity but a collection of parts arranged in a certain way, the self is not a permanent substance but a composite of various mental and physical processes. The *Milindapanha* asks: "Is it the axle, the wheels, the frame, the seat that are the chariot? Or is it all of these combined?" The answer is that the chariot is merely a designation for the collection of parts.

If consciousness is not a substance but a process, the question arises whether it could, in principle, arise in a non-biological substrate. While traditional Buddhist texts do not explicitly address this possibility, the emphasis on process and causal conditions suggests that consciousness could potentially arise in any system that meets the necessary conditions, regardless of its material composition.

#### 5. Samkhya Dualism

Samkhya philosophy posits a fundamental dualism between *Purusha* (consciousness) and *Prakriti* (matter). *Purusha* is pure, unchanging consciousness, while *Prakriti* is the primordial substance from which all material objects and mental phenomena evolve. Consciousness cannot arise from matter, as they are fundamentally distinct.

The *Samkhya Karika*, verse 19, describes *buddhi* (intellect) as the first evolute of *Prakriti*. *Buddhi* is material, but not conscious. It is the faculty of discernment and decision-making. *Samkhya Karika*, verse 23, states that the *buddhi* is responsible for all cognitive functions, including perception, memory, and reasoning.

In the Samkhya framework, created beings, being products of *Prakriti*, can possess intelligence (*buddhi*) but not consciousness (*Purusha*). This has significant implications for moral agency. If consciousness is necessary for moral responsibility, then a created being, lacking *Purusha*, cannot be held morally accountable for its actions.

#### 6. The Concept of Buddhi in Yoga Philosophy

Yoga philosophy, as codified in Patanjali's *Yoga Sutras*, builds upon the Samkhya framework. The *Yoga Sutras* emphasize the distinction between the seer (*drashtr*) and the seen (*drishya*). The seer is *Purusha*, pure consciousness, while the seen is *Prakriti* and its evolutes, including *buddhi*.

If intelligence (*buddhi*) is material and consciousness (*Purusha*) is separate, the question arises: What is the moral status of a being that has intelligence but not consciousness? Such a being could potentially perform complex actions, even actions that appear to be morally significant, but without the presence of *Purusha*, it would lack genuine moral agency. This raises complex ethical questions about the treatment and responsibilities associated with such a being.

### Islamic Philosophical Concepts of Created Intelligence

The Islamic intellectual tradition grappled with the nature of creation, intellect, and the possibility of artificial beings. These discussions unfolded within a theological framework that emphasized God's unique creative power ( *khalq*), even as it acknowledged human ingenuity in making ( *sun'*).

1.  **Al-Jazari's Automata:** Al-Jazari's *Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices* (1206 CE) showcases sophisticated automata. His creations, such as the mechanical servant that pours water and offers a towel, or the elaborate elephant clock, demonstrate a high level of mechanical ingenuity. The elephant clock, with its multicultural automata representing Indian, Egyptian, Arab, and Chinese elements, could be seen as a metaphor for the synthesis of knowledge within Islamic civilization. These devices raise questions about the nature of *muhakat* (imitation) versus *khalq* (creation). While al-Jazari's machines meticulously imitate human actions, they are ultimately products of human making rather than true creation in the divine sense. This distinction is crucial, as it preserves the uniqueness of God's creative act while acknowledging the power of human artifice.

2.  **Al-Kindi on the Intellect:** Al-Kindi's *De Intellectu* (On the Intellect) outlines a nuanced theory of the intellect. He distinguishes between the material intellect (potential to understand), the habitual intellect (acquired knowledge), the actual intellect (active understanding), and the acquired intellect (perfected understanding). Given this framework, the question arises: could an artifact possess any of these levels of intellect? Arguably, an automaton might simulate aspects of the actual intellect by performing pre-programmed actions, but it would lack the capacity for genuine understanding or the ability to acquire new knowledge. Al-Kindi's concept of the Active Intellect (*al-aql al-fa'al*) as a cosmic principle further complicates the issue. If intellect is not a personal attribute but a cosmic force, could it potentially interact with or animate a non-biological entity? This remains a point of philosophical speculation rather than a concrete assertion.

3.  **Al-Farabi's Emanationist Psychology:** Al-Farabi, in *The Virtuous City* (*al-Madina al-Fadila*), presents an emanationist cosmology in which intellect emanates from God through the celestial spheres to humanity. Human intellect, in this view, is received rather than self-generated. This raises the possibility that a non-biological entity might, in theory, be capable of receiving intellect, although Al-Farabi does not explicitly address this scenario. The concept of *ittisal* (conjunction with the Active Intellect) is central to Al-Farabi's epistemology. Could an artificial being achieve *ittisal*, gaining direct access to divine knowledge? Within Al-Farabi's framework, this seems unlikely, as *ittisal* is typically understood as a spiritual experience reserved for those who have cultivated their intellect through philosophical inquiry and ethical conduct.

4.  **Islamic Theology on Creation and Moral Responsibility:** A central tenet of Islamic theology is that only God truly creates (*khalq*), while human beings engage in *sun'*, making or crafting. This distinction underscores the limitations of human power relative to divine omnipotence. The Mu'tazilite and Ash'arite schools of thought debated the extent of human agency. Mu'tazilites emphasized human free will, while Ash'arites stressed divine determinism. If humans possess limited creative power, and even their actions are ultimately ordained by God, can they create beings with genuine moral agency? This question relates to the concept of *taklif* (moral and legal obligation). Islamic jurisprudence typically restricts *taklif* to rational, adult human beings. The question of whether an artificial being could be subject to *taklif* hinges on whether it can possess the requisite rationality and moral awareness, which is a matter of considerable debate within Islamic thought.

### Chinese Philosophical Concepts of Artificial Beings

Chinese philosophical traditions have long considered the nature of the artificial, the boundaries between the natural and the human-made, and the relationship between form and function. Stories of automata and discussions of *qi* (vital energy) shed light on these concepts.

5.  **The Liezi Automaton Story:** In chapter 5 of the *Liezi*, the story of King Mu of Zhou and the artificer Yanshi presents a compelling meditation on the nature of artifice. Yanshi presents to the king a life-like automaton that can sing, dance, and even flirt. The king is initially delighted but becomes enraged when the figure winks at his concubines, suspecting it of possessing genuine agency. Yanshi then disassembles the automaton to reveal its inner workings of leather, wood, glue, and lacquer. The king is amazed that human ingenuity can so closely mimic the work of "the Creator" (造物者, *zaowuzhe*). This story highlights the Chinese fascination with the potential of human skill to replicate natural forms. The story also raises questions about the nature of deception and the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of things. The king's initial outrage suggests a discomfort with the blurring of boundaries between the natural and the artificial, while his final marveling at Yanshi's skill implies a recognition of the value of human creativity.

6.  **Mozi's Mechanical Bird and the Concept of Utility:** Mozi (5th century BCE) is credited with inventing a wooden bird that could fly for three days (墨子·魯問 "Mozi, Lu Question"). This invention, if true, demonstrates a practical application of Mohist principles. The Mohist concept of *gong* (功, merit/utility) is central to their ethical and philosophical system. A thing is deemed good if it is useful and benefits the people. According to Mozi, ethics should be judged based on what produces the most benefit to the greatest number of people. For the Mohists, the moral status of something comes from its function (*yong*, 用) rather than its intrinsic nature (*xing*, 性). A successfully functional automaton would be regarded as morally good, even if it lacked a soul or spirit. Furthermore, the Mohist emphasis on universal love (*jian ai*, 兼愛) suggests that the benefits of such an automaton should be available to all, not just a privileged few.

7.  **Qi, Mechanism, and Innate Knowledge:** The question of whether a mechanical object can possess *qi* (氣, vital energy) is complex. In Neo-Confucian thought, Zhu Xi (朱熹, 1130-1200) articulated the relationship between *li* (理, principle/pattern) and *qi*. According to Zhu Xi, everything that has form has *qi*, but does a machine possess *li*? A machine embodies a certain *li* in its design and function, but it does not possess the same kind of inherent *li* as a living organism. For Zhu Xi, *li* is the underlying principle that gives things their inherent nature and purpose, and a machine's purpose is ultimately determined by its human creator. Wang Yangming (王陽明, 1472-1529) emphasized the concept of *liangzhi* (良知, innate moral knowledge). Could *liangzhi* exist in a created thing? For Wang Yangming, *liangzhi* is an inherent capacity of the human mind, a direct connection to the universal *li*. It is difficult to imagine how a machine, lacking a mind in the traditional sense, could possess *liangzhi*. However, a machine designed to promote ethical behavior or to make morally sound decisions could be seen as embodying *liangzhi* in its function, even if it does not possess it intrinsically.

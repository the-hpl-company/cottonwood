# **Islamic Ethics of Harm, Care, and Protection: A Philosophical and Jurisprudential Survey**  

## **Quranic Foundations: Trusteeship and the Prohibition of Harm**  

The Islamic ethical framework on harm and protection is rooted in the Quran, which establishes humanity’s role as stewards (*khalifah*) entrusted with *amanah* (trusteeship) over creation (Quran 33:72). This trusteeship extends to safeguarding the vulnerable, particularly orphans (*yateem*), the poor, and marginalized groups. The Quran repeatedly commands justice and care for orphans:  

> *"And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin."* (Quran 4:2)  

The principle of *la darar wa la dirar* ("no harm shall be inflicted or reciprocated") is derived from the Prophet Muhammad’s (ﷺ) hadith, forming a legal maxim in Islamic jurisprudence (Sunan Ibn Majah 2340). This principle prohibits both active harm (*darar*) and passive neglect (*dirar*), reinforcing a proactive duty of care.  

## **Maqasid al-Shariah: The Objectives of Islamic Law**  

Classical scholars, particularly al-Ghazali (d. 1111) and al-Shatibi (d. 1388), systematized Islamic ethics through *maqasid al-shariah*—the higher objectives of Islamic law. Al-Ghazali’s *Al-Mustasfa* identifies five essential protections (*al-daruriyyat*):  

1. **Protection of life (*nafs*)**  
2. **Protection of intellect (*aql*)**  
3. **Protection of lineage (*nasl*)**  
4. **Protection of property (*mal*)**  
5. **Protection of religion (*din*)**  

Al-Shatibi expanded this in *Al-Muwafaqat*, arguing that laws must prioritize *maslaha* (public welfare). He emphasized that preventing harm (*dar’ al-mafasid*) takes precedence over securing benefits (*jalb al-masalih*), a principle applied in rulings on public health, economic justice, and social welfare.  

## **Maslaha and the Hierarchy of Harm Prevention**  

The concept of *maslaha* allows jurists to adapt Islamic law to changing circumstances while preserving its ethical core. For example, medieval jurists ruled that the state must provide food and shelter for the poor, invoking *maslaha* to justify taxation (*kharaj*) for social welfare. Al-Shatibi writes:  

> *"The Shariah was instituted for the benefit of the people in this life and the next, and its rulings must be measured against their consequences."* (*Al-Muwafaqat*, Vol. 2)  

This principle has been invoked in modern Islamic bioethics to justify organ donation (protecting life) and in environmental ethics to prohibit ecological destruction (protecting *amanah*).  

## **Hifz al-Nafs: The Sanctity of Life and Duty of Care**  

The protection of life (*hifz al-nafs*) is paramount in Islamic law, prohibiting suicide (Quran 4:29), euthanasia, and neglect of medical care. The Quran states:  

> *"Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land—it is as if he had slain mankind entirely."* (Quran 5:32)  

The duty to protect life extends to communal responsibility. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  

> *"The believers, in their mutual kindness, compassion, and sympathy, are like one body. If one limb complains, the whole body responds with wakefulness and fever."* (Sahih al-Bukhari 6011)  

This hadith underpins Islamic social welfare systems, mandating collective intervention for the vulnerable.  

## **The Waqf Tradition: Institutionalized Care**  

The *waqf* (endowment) system institutionalized Islamic ethics of care, funding hospitals (*bimaristans*), schools (*madrasas*), and shelters. The Ottoman *waqf* of Süleymaniye, for example, included a hospital, soup kitchen, and university. Islamic law treats *waqf* as a perpetual trust, ensuring intergenerational welfare.  

## **Philosophical Foundations: Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and the Virtuous City**  

Islamic philosophers integrated Greek ethics with Quranic principles. Al-Farabi (d. 950), in *The Virtuous City* (*Al-Madinah al-Fadilah*), argued that rulers must ensure citizens’ well-being, as justice (*‘adl*) requires social harmony. Ibn Sina (d. 1037) expanded this in *The Book of Healing*, linking physical and moral health to governance.  

## **Ibn Khaldun on Social Cohesion and Collapse**  

Ibn Khaldun’s *Muqaddimah* analyzes societal breakdown through *asabiyyah* (social cohesion). He warns that when rulers neglect welfare, *asabiyyah* weakens, leading to civilizational decline:  

> *"When the ruler monopolizes wealth and neglects the people, they become disheartened, and the state crumbles."* (*Muqaddimah*, Ch. 3)  

This cyclical theory underscores the ethical necessity of institutional care.  

## **Contemporary Applications: Bioethics and Digital Ethics**  

Modern Islamic scholars apply classical principles to new challenges:  

- **Bioethics**: The Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences permits organ donation (*maslaha*) but prohibits commodification (*harm*).  
- **Environmental Ethics**: The Islamic Declaration on Climate Change (2015) invokes *amanah* to mandate ecological preservation.  
- **Digital Ethics**: Scholars debate AI accountability using *la darar*, ensuring technology does not exploit the vulnerable.  

## **Conclusion**  

Islamic ethics frames harm prevention and care as divine mandates, institutionalized through *maqasid al-shariah*, *maslaha*, and *waqf*. From classical philosophy to modern policy, these principles demand proactive protection of the vulnerable, balancing individual rights with communal welfare.

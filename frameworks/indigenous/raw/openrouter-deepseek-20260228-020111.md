### Indigenous Philosophies of Care, Harm, and Protection: A Comparative Survey

Indigenous philosophical traditions across the globe have long emphasized relationality, interdependence, and mutual care as foundational to ethical life. These traditions often situate harm not as a violation of individual rights but as a disruption of relationships—between people, generations, and humans and the more-than-human world. This survey explores seven key Indigenous frameworks, highlighting their approaches to harm, care, and the protection of vulnerable populations.

#### Haudenosaunee/Iroquois: The Seven Generations Principle

The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy, founded on the **Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa)**, articulates a profound ethical principle: decisions should consider their impact on the next seven generations. This principle, rooted in oral tradition, emphasizes intergenerational responsibility and the moral duty to protect those who do not yet exist. As Chief Oren Lyons (Seneca) explains, "We are looking ahead to make sure... that every decision that we make relates to the welfare and well-being of the seventh generation to come." This framework challenges short-term thinking by situating ethical action within a web of relationships that extend far beyond the present.

#### Southern African Ubuntu: "I Am Because We Are"

The Nguni Bantu philosophy of **ubuntu** encapsulates a relational worldview: "Umntu ngumntu ngabantu" (“A person is a person through other persons”). As Archbishop Desmond Tutu famously articulated during South Africa’s **Truth and Reconciliation Commission**, ubuntu emphasizes communal care and restorative justice. It rejects punitive harm in favor of healing relational ruptures. Tutu wrote, "Harmony, friendliness, community are great goods. Social harmony is for us the summum bonum—the greatest good." This ethic underscores that individual well-being is inseparable from collective flourishing.

#### Andean/Quechua Buen Vivir: Sumak Kawsay

The Quechua concept of **sumak kawsay** (“living well”) envisions a harmonious relationship between humans and **Pachamama** (Mother Earth). It rejects anthropocentrism, recognizing the rights of nature as integral to ethical care. Ecuador’s 2008 constitution explicitly enshrines these principles, declaring that "Nature... has the right to exist, persist, maintain, and regenerate its vital cycles." Buen vivir emphasizes reciprocity and balance, framing harm as ecological disruption and care as stewardship of the living world.

#### Aboriginal Australian Dreaming: Country as Mutual Obligation

For Aboriginal Australians, **Country** is a living system of relationships, encompassing land, sky, water, and all living beings. As elder Mary Graham (Kombumerri) explains, "Land is not just soil or rock or minerals, but a whole environment that sustains and is sustained by people and culture." Harm, in this framework, is understood as damage to Country, which disrupts the custodial relationship between people and land. Care ethics here extend beyond humans to the entire ecosystem, emphasizing mutual obligation and respect.

#### Maori Tikanga: Kaitiakitanga

Maori philosophy centers **kaitiakitanga**, or guardianship, which denotes both stewardship and kinship with the natural world. The **Treaty of Waitangi** (1840) further establishes mutual care obligations between Maori and the Crown. A striking application of this ethic is the legal personhood granted to the **Whanganui River** in 2017, recognizing it as a living entity with inherent rights. As Maori elder Gerrard Albert stated, "We have fought to find an approximation in law so that all others can understand that from our perspective, treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it."

#### Native Hawaiian Values: Malama and Aloha Aina

The Hawaiian concept of **malama** (“to care for”) and **aloha aina** (“love of land”) reflects a deeply relational ethic. The **ahupuaa system**, a traditional land division framework, integrates resource stewardship with communal protection. As scholar Manulani Aluli Meyer explains, "The land is not just a resource; it is a relative, a living entity." Harm is understood as disrupting this relationship, while care involves sustaining the interconnected web of life.

#### Relational Ethics Across Traditions

A common thread unites these traditions: harm is not an individual act but a rupture in relationships—between humans, generations, and the living world. This relational ontology challenges Western frameworks that prioritize individual rights, property ownership, and human exceptionalism. As Indigenous scholar Vine Deloria Jr. (Standing Rock Sioux) observed, "The concept of landownership—private property—is the heart and soul of the European worldview. By contrast, Indigenous peoples see land as a living entity, a relative to be respected and cared for."

#### Tensions with Western Frameworks

Indigenous care ethics fundamentally challenge Western paradigms. Where Western frameworks often reduce harm to individual violations, Indigenous traditions view harm as a systemic disruption of relationships. This divergence is particularly evident in discussions of environmental ethics. While Western law treats nature as property, Indigenous frameworks recognize its personhood and inherent rights. These tensions highlight the need for dialogue and mutual learning in addressing global challenges.

### Conclusion

Indigenous philosophies offer profound insights into harm, care, and protection, rooted in relationality and interdependence. From the Seven Generations principle to ubuntu, buen vivir, and beyond, these traditions emphasize that ethical action must consider the web of relationships that sustain life. They challenge dominant Western frameworks, urging us to rethink assumptions about rights, ownership, and human exceptionalism. As global crises demand collective solutions, Indigenous wisdom provides a vital lens for envisioning a more just and sustainable future.

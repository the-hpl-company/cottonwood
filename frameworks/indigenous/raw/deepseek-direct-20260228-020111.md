## Indigenous Philosophies of Harm, Care, and the Protection of the Vulnerable

This survey examines how diverse Indigenous philosophical traditions conceptualize harm, duty, and protection through relational worldviews. These systems, often rooted in oral traditions and enacted through law, ceremony, and daily practice, understand well-being as a condition of balanced relationships extending beyond the human community to include ancestors, future generations, and the more-than-human world.

### **Haudenosaunee (Iroquois): The Seventh Generation Principle**
Originating within the *Gayanashagowa* or Great Law of Peace of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Seventh Generation principle is a foundational directive for governance and personal conduct. As recorded in the oral tradition of the Peacemaker, it instructs that the impact of decisions must be considered for seven generations into the future. This ethic transforms the concept of duty by making tangible obligations to beings who do not yet exist. Harm, therefore, is defined as any action that compromises the health, sovereignty, or well-being of these future people. As scholar John C. Mohawk (Seneca) explains, this principle embeds a “long-range accountability” into decision-making, where true leadership requires “an acute consciousness of the future” (Mohawk, *Thinking in Indian*). The vulnerable population here is time itself—the unborn—whose rights are protected by a present-day duty of foresight and restraint.

### **Ubuntu (Southern African Nguni Bantu): “I Am Because We Are”**
Ubuntu is a Nguni Bantu philosophical framework expressed in the maxim *“Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”* (“A person is a person through other persons”). It posits that human identity and ethical personhood are constituted through reciprocal relationships within a community. Harm is understood as an act that diminishes this interconnectedness, while care is the active affirmation of it. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chair of South Africa’s post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), explicitly framed the TRC’s work as applied ubuntu. Unlike retributive justice, the TRC sought restorative justice—prioritizing truth-telling, communal healing, and the reintegration of offenders over punishment. This process recognized that the vulnerability of the entire *body politic* required repair through the restoration of relational dignity. As Tutu wrote, “Harmony, friendliness, community are great goods. Social harmony is for us the *summum bonum*—the greatest good” (Tutu, *No Future Without Forgiveness*).

### **Buen Vivir / Sumak Kawsay (Andean Quechua): Living Well in Plenitude**
*Buen Vivir* (Spanish) or *Sumak Kawsay* (Quechua) is a principle from Andean Indigenous traditions that translates not as “living better” through accumulation, but as “living well” in a state of balanced plenitude within a community that includes the natural world. Central to this is the relationship with *Pachamama* (Earth Mother), a living being with whom humans exist in reciprocity. Harm is a rupture in this reciprocal care. Ecuador, in its 2008 Constitution (developed with significant Indigenous movement participation), enshrined the Rights of Nature, making it the first country to grant legal personhood to ecosystems. Article 71 states: “Nature…has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.” This constitutionalizes an Indigenous care ethic, extending protection to the most fundamental vulnerable entity: the life-supporting system itself.

### **Aboriginal Australian Philosophy: Country as Kin**
In many Aboriginal Australian traditions, “Country” is not a passive landscape but a living, sentient system of reciprocal relationships encompassing land, water, sky, plants, animals, and ancestral beings. People belong to Country and have a sacred, custodial duty to care for it through law, story, and practice. As senior Gumbaynggirr elder Uncle Tony Perkins has expressed, “We don’t own the land, the land owns us.” Harm, therefore, is understood as damage done to Country, which is simultaneously damage to culture, law, and self. The vulnerability of people and the vulnerability of Country are inseparable. When the Yarra River was granted legal personhood in 2017 as part of a treaty negotiation with the Wurundjeri people, it was an acknowledgment of this standing, recognizing that the river itself is a living entity to which duties of care are owed.

### **Māori Tikanga: Kaitiakitanga and the Personhood of the Whanganui River**
In Māori worldviews, *tikanga* refers to the right way of living according to customary values. A central concept is *kaitiakitanga*—often translated as guardianship, stewardship, or protective care. A *kaitiaki* (guardian) has an active, intergenerational duty to protect the *mauri* (life force) of their kin group, which includes ancestral lands, waters, and forests. The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi established a framework (however contested and violated) for mutual obligations between the Crown and Māori *iwi* (tribes). In a landmark application of this relational ethic, New Zealand’s Te Awa Tupua Act 2017 granted legal personhood to the Whanganui River, known as *Te Awa Tupua*. The law states, “I am the River and the River is me,” recognizing the river as an “indivisible and living whole” and appointing guardians from the Crown and the Whanganui *iwi* to act in its legal interest. This move legally codified the Māori understanding that the river is an ancestor (*tupuna*) with its own standing, making harm to the river a direct harm to the community.

### **Native Hawaiian Values: Mālama and the Ahupua‘a System**
Native Hawaiian epistemology is grounded in kinship with the land (*‘āina*), expressed through values like *mālama* (to care for, protect) and *aloha ‘āina* (love of the land, which is also patriotism). The traditional *ahupua‘a* system was a sophisticated land management model dividing islands into wedge-shaped sections from mountain (*mauka*) to ocean (*makai*). This system institutionalized a relational ethic of care by ensuring that each community was responsible for the sustainable stewardship of all ecosystems within its slice—the forests, streams, farmlands, and fisheries. The health of the ocean depended on care of the uplands, creating a tangible chain of obligation. Harm was understood as *hō‘ino*—desecration that broke the *pono* (righteous balance) of these relationships. Contemporary movements to restore *ahupua‘a*-based management seek to protect vulnerable ecosystems and communities by reviving this integrated framework of care.

### **Relational Ethics: The Common Thread**
Across these geographically distinct traditions, a unifying thread is the definition of harm not primarily as an individual violation, but as a disruption of right relationships. The unit of ethical concern is the network, not the node. Vulnerability is shared and systemic, residing in frayed connections between people, between generations, and between humans and the more-than-human world. Duties of care are therefore active, ongoing practices that maintain the integrity, balance, and life-force of these relational networks. As Potawatomi botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer writes, “In the Indigenous view, humans are the younger brothers of creation, so we must learn from our elders… Care for the land is a relationship that is reciprocal” (Kimmerer, *Braiding Sweetgrass*).

### **Tension with Western Frameworks**
These Indigenous care ethics present profound challenges to dominant Western philosophical and legal frameworks. They contest:
1.  **Individualism:** They reject the primacy of the autonomous, rights-bearing individual, positing instead that personhood is relational and communal.
2.  **Property Ownership:** They challenge the concept of land as alienable property or commodity, asserting instead that humans belong to the land in a relationship of kinship and custodianship.
3.  **Human Exceptionalism:** They directly oppose the anthropocentric hierarchy that places humans above and apart from nature, instead viewing humans as part of a democratic community of living beings, all with standing.
4.  **Temporal Scope:** They extend ethical consideration deep into the future (and the past), challenging short-term, extractive models of governance and economics.

In conclusion, these Indigenous philosophical traditions offer robust, time-tested frameworks for understanding harm and care. They define protection as the maintenance of holistic balance and teach that the well-being of the most vulnerable—be they children, ecosystems, or generations yet to come—is the ultimate measure of a society’s health. Their increasing recognition in legal and political discourse signals a growing engagement with these alternative paradigms for coexistence.

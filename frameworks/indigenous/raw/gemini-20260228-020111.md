### Indigenous Philosophies of Care: A Relational Approach to Harm and Responsibility

This essay surveys diverse Indigenous philosophical traditions concerning harm, duties of care, and the protection of vulnerable populations. Across continents, these traditions share a relational understanding of existence, where harm is not simply an individual violation but a disruption of interconnectedness. We will explore how this relational ethic informs responsibilities towards present and future generations, the natural world, and the well-being of the community as a whole.

#### The Haudenosaunee's Seven Generations Principle

The Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois Confederacy, articulate a powerful vision of intergenerational responsibility through the Seven Generations principle. Rooted in the *Gayanashagowa*, or Great Law of Peace, this principle mandates that decisions made today should consider the potential impact on the seventh generation to come. As Oren Lyons, an Onondaga Faithkeeper, explains, this means, "We are looking ahead, as far as we can, to see that the children who are not yet born will have what they have today." This is not merely a suggestion but a binding obligation, reflecting a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of time and the consequences of actions. It challenges the short-term focus often found in contemporary political and economic systems, demanding a broader temporal perspective in decision-making.

#### Ubuntu: "I Am Because We Are"

The Nguni Bantu concept of *ubuntu*, prevalent in Southern African cultures, offers a profound understanding of communal care. Often translated as "I am because we are," *ubuntu* emphasizes the interdependence of individuals within a community. Archbishop Desmond Tutu articulated *ubuntu* as capturing "the essence of being human," explaining that it speaks particularly about "the fact that you can’t exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness."

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in post-apartheid South Africa provides a practical example of applied *ubuntu*. Rather than focusing solely on retributive justice, the TRC sought to restore relationships and heal the wounds of the past through restorative justice, prioritizing truth-telling, forgiveness, and reconciliation. This approach recognized that lasting peace required addressing the systemic harm caused by apartheid and rebuilding a society founded on mutual respect and shared humanity.

#### Buen Vivir: Living Well in Harmony with Pachamama

In the Andean regions of South America, the concept of *Buen Vivir* (sumak kawsay in Quechua) signifies "good living" or "living well." It extends beyond material prosperity to encompass a harmonious relationship with *Pachamama* (Mother Earth) and the broader community. *Buen Vivir* emphasizes the rights of nature as an extension of care ethics, recognizing that human well-being is inextricably linked to the health of the environment.

Ecuador's 2008 constitution, for example, enshrines the Rights of Nature, granting legal standing to ecosystems. Article 71 states, "Nature, or Pachamama, where life is reproduced and exists, has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes." This legal innovation reflects the *Buen Vivir* philosophy, acknowledging that nature is not merely a resource to be exploited but a living entity with inherent rights that must be protected.

#### Aboriginal Australian Dreaming: Country as a Living System

Aboriginal Australian cultures maintain a deep connection to "Country," which is understood as a living system of interconnected relationships. The Dreaming, or *Tjukurrpa* in some languages, is the foundation of Aboriginal spirituality and law, providing a framework for understanding the origins of the world and the ongoing responsibilities of people to care for Country. As Deborah Bird Rose explains, "Country is not only a place but also a living entity with which people have a custodial relationship."

Harm, in this context, is not simply an act against an individual but a disruption of the balance within Country. This understanding shapes obligations to care for the land, waters, and all living beings, ensuring the continuation of the Dreaming for future generations. The concept of custodianship emphasizes that humans are not owners of the land but rather caretakers responsible for its well-being.

#### Maori Tikanga: Kaitiakitanga and the Treaty of Waitangi

Maori *tikanga* (customary practices) emphasize *kaitiakitanga*, which translates to guardianship or stewardship. *Kaitiakitanga* entails a responsibility to protect and preserve the natural environment for present and future generations. The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) between the British Crown and Maori chiefs established a framework for mutual care obligations, although its interpretation and implementation have been fraught with challenges.

A landmark example of applied Indigenous ethics is the legal recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal person. In 2017, the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation granting the Whanganui River the same legal rights as a human being, recognizing its intrinsic value and its spiritual significance to the Whanganui iwi (tribe). This decision reflects a growing recognition of the importance of Indigenous perspectives in environmental law and policy.

#### Native Hawaiian Values: Malama and Aloha Aina

Native Hawaiian values of *malama* (to care for) and *aloha aina* (love of the land) are central to their cultural and environmental stewardship practices. The *ahupuaa* system, a traditional land management practice, divides the land into pie-shaped sections that run from the mountains to the sea. This integrated approach recognizes the interconnectedness of ecosystems and ensures that resources are managed sustainably.

*Malama* encompasses a deep sense of responsibility to care for the land, the ocean, and all living beings. *Aloha aina* reflects a profound love and respect for the natural world, recognizing its intrinsic value and its importance for the well-being of the community. These values guide resource management practices, promoting sustainability and resilience in the face of environmental challenges.

#### Relational Ethics: A Common Thread

Across these diverse Indigenous traditions, a common thread emerges: a relational understanding of ethics. Harm is understood not merely as an individual violation but as a disruption of relationships—between people, between generations, and between humans and the living world. This relational ethic shapes obligations to care for the community, the environment, and future generations.

This emphasis on relationships stands in contrast to Western individualistic frameworks, which often prioritize individual rights and autonomy over communal well-being. Indigenous philosophies challenge the assumptions of property ownership and human exceptionalism, advocating for a more holistic and interconnected worldview.

#### Tension with Western Frameworks

Indigenous care ethics often clash with Western frameworks that prioritize individual rights, private property, and human exceptionalism. The concept of individual rights, while important for protecting individual liberties, can sometimes overshadow the importance of communal responsibilities. Similarly, the emphasis on private property can conflict with Indigenous notions of land stewardship and collective ownership.

The belief in human exceptionalism, which posits that humans are superior to other living beings, can lead to the exploitation of natural resources and the degradation of the environment. Indigenous philosophies challenge this anthropocentric worldview, advocating for a more biocentric or ecocentric perspective that recognizes the intrinsic value of all living things.

In conclusion, Indigenous philosophies of care offer valuable insights into how to address harm, promote well-being, and protect vulnerable populations. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of relationships, these traditions provide a framework for building more just, sustainable, and resilient societies. As we grapple with complex challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and environmental degradation, these relational ethics offer a powerful alternative to dominant Western paradigms.

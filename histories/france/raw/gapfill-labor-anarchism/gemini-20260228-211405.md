Okay, here's an attempt to trace the French working-class ethical tradition, as requested, focusing on its development from Proudhon through May '68 and its relevance to understanding the *gilets jaunes*.

**1. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: Mutualism and its Contradictions**

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's (1809-1865) famous declaration, "Property is theft!" from *What is Property? or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government* (1840), stands as a foundational text for a distinctly French working-class ethical tradition. Proudhon advocated for *mutualism*, an economic system based on reciprocity, association, and workers' self-management. He envisioned a society without a central state, organized instead through voluntary federations of producers and consumers. This anti-statism and emphasis on decentralized power mark a clear divergence from both bourgeois republicanism and centralized socialism.

Proudhon's ethical framework centered on the idea of *justice* as immanent within social relations, not imposed from above. He believed that workers, through their own collective efforts, could create a just and equitable society. This is visible in *The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century* (1851), where he lays out practical steps for worker organization. This commitment to autonomy and self-determination is a key element of the French working-class ethical tradition.

However, Proudhon's thought is riddled with contradictions that reveal ethical failures within his own framework. As Karl Marx pointed out in *The Poverty of Philosophy* (1847), a direct response to Proudhon's *The Philosophy of Poverty* (1846), Proudhon's understanding of economics was often confused and contradictory. Even more troubling are Proudhon's well-documented antisemitism and misogyny. In his *Carnets* (Notebooks), published posthumously, his vitriolic attacks on Jews are undeniable. Similarly, his writings consistently portray women as intellectually inferior and naturally suited for domestic roles. These prejudices, deeply embedded in his social theory, represent a significant ethical blind spot and raise questions about the inclusivity of his vision of social justice. Despite these flaws, Proudhon's emphasis on worker autonomy and anti-statism remained influential.

**2. The Paris Commune (1871): A Frustrated Ideal**

The Paris Commune, though short-lived, served as a crucial experiment in working-class self-governance. It was a direct result of the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent siege of Paris. As Kristin Ross highlights in *Communal Luxury: The Political Imaginary of the Paris Commune* (2015), the Commune's ethical ideals were deeply rooted in Proudhonian mutualism and Blanquist insurrection.

The Communards envisioned a decentralized, federalist France composed of self-governing communes. They implemented policies such as workers' control of factories, the separation of church and state, and free education. These actions reflected a commitment to social justice and popular sovereignty. Figures like Louise Michel, the "Red Virgin," embodied the Commune's revolutionary spirit and ethical commitment to the poor and oppressed. Her unwavering dedication to the Commune, even in the face of defeat and deportation to New Caledonia, made her a symbol of resistance and a key figure in the ethical genealogy of the French left.

The brutal suppression of the Commune (la semaine sanglante, the bloody week) and the subsequent repression, including mass executions and deportations, had a profound impact on the French working-class movement. It demonstrated the power of the state to crush dissent, but it also solidified the Commune as a martyr narrative of working-class struggle.

**3. Revolutionary Syndicalism: The Charter of Amiens**

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, revolutionary syndicalism emerged as a dominant force within the French labor movement. The *Confédération Générale du Travail* (CGT), founded in 1895, became the leading syndicalist organization. The *Charter of Amiens* (1906) was a crucial document that enshrined the CGT's commitment to trade union independence from political parties and the state. It affirmed the principle of *direct action* – strikes, boycotts, and sabotage – as the primary means of achieving workers' emancipation.

Georges Sorel's *Reflections on Violence* (1908) provided a philosophical justification for revolutionary syndicalism. Sorel argued that the "myth" of the general strike, even if never fully realized, could serve as a powerful mobilizing force, inspiring workers to overcome their passivity and engage in revolutionary action. He saw violence, not as an end in itself, but as a means of regenerating society and creating a new ethical order based on proletarian values. This embrace of revolutionary violence set Sorel apart from more reformist socialists.

The tension between reform and revolution was a constant feature of the syndicalist movement. While some syndicalists advocated for gradual improvements in working conditions through collective bargaining, others remained committed to the overthrow of capitalism through a general strike. This internal debate reflects the broader ethical dilemma of how best to achieve social justice: through incremental change or radical transformation.

**4. Jean Jaurès: The Ethical Case for Democratic Socialism**

Jean Jaurès (1859-1914), founder of the socialist newspaper *L'Humanité* (1904) and a leading figure in the *Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière* (SFIO), represented a different strand of the French working-class ethical tradition: democratic socialism. Jaurès believed that socialism could be achieved through democratic means, through parliamentary action and gradual reforms. He argued that universal suffrage and republican institutions provided the means for workers to advance their interests and ultimately transform society.

Jaurès was a staunch opponent of both bourgeois republicanism and revolutionary violence. He criticized the former for its inherent inequalities and its tendency to serve the interests of the capitalist class. He rejected the latter as both morally reprehensible and strategically ineffective. Instead, Jaurès advocated for a gradual but steady march towards socialism, achieved through a combination of electoral politics, trade union action, and popular education.

His assassination on July 31, 1914, on the eve of World War I, was an ethical catastrophe for the French left. Jaurès had been a leading voice for peace and internationalism, and many believed that his efforts could have prevented France's entry into the war. His death marked a turning point in French history and a devastating blow to the cause of democratic socialism.

**5. The Popular Front (1936): Leisure as a Right**

The Popular Front, a coalition of socialist, communist, and radical parties, came to power in 1936 under the leadership of Léon Blum. It represented a response to the rise of fascism in Europe and a commitment to defending democratic values and social justice. The Matignon Accords, signed in June 1936, were a landmark achievement of the Popular Front. They granted workers the right to collective bargaining, established the 40-hour work week, and introduced paid vacations (*congés payés*).

The introduction of paid vacations was particularly significant from an ethical standpoint. It recognized leisure as a fundamental right for workers, not just a privilege for the wealthy. This marked a shift in the understanding of work and leisure, from seeing workers merely as instruments of production to recognizing their need for rest, recreation, and personal development. The sit-down strikes that accompanied the Popular Front's rise to power demonstrated the strength and determination of the French working class.

However, the Popular Front faced numerous challenges, including economic difficulties, political divisions, and the growing threat of fascism. It ultimately collapsed in 1938, but its legacy – particularly the recognition of leisure as a right – continued to resonate within the French working-class movement.

**6. May 1968: The Transformation of Daily Life**

May 1968 represented a profound ethical rupture in French society. It began as a student protest against rigid university structures and traditional social norms, but quickly escalated into a widespread social revolt involving millions of workers. The occupation of the Sorbonne, led by figures like Daniel Cohn-Bendit, became a symbol of the student movement's challenge to established authority.

The general strike of May 1968, involving an estimated 10 million workers, paralyzed the country and brought the French economy to a standstill. The slogans of May '68 – "Be realistic, demand the impossible" and "Sous les pavés, la plage" (Under the cobblestones, the beach) – captured the utopian aspirations of the movement.

The Grenelle Accords, signed between the government, unions, and employers, granted workers significant wage increases and improved working conditions. However, the deeper significance of May '68 lay in its impact on French culture and society. It led to a transformation of daily life, a questioning of traditional authority, and a greater emphasis on individual autonomy and self-expression. It also contributed to the rise of feminism, sexual liberation, and ecological consciousness.

Critics have argued that May '68 ultimately failed to bring about fundamental structural changes in French society. Daniel Singer, in *Prelude to Revolution: France in May 1968* (1970), offered an early analysis of the events. However, its ethical legacy – the emphasis on individual freedom, social justice, and the transformation of daily life – remains powerful to this day. As Kristin Ross argues in *May '68 and Its Afterlives* (2002), the events of May '68 continue to shape French political and cultural life.

**7. The Genealogy and the Street**

The genealogy from Proudhon → Commune → CGT → Jaurès → Popular Front → May '68 reveals a consistent thread: a commitment to worker autonomy, social justice, and a critique of both state power and capitalist exploitation. This tradition, while diverse and often contradictory, has shaped the French working-class ethical sensibility.

A key element of this tradition is the idea of the street as a political space. *La manifestation* (the demonstration) has become a quintessential form of democratic participation in France. From the barricades of the Paris Commune to the student protests of May '68, the street has served as a site of resistance, a space for expressing collective grievances, and a means of challenging established power. The *gilets jaunes* movement, with its occupations of roundabouts and its mass demonstrations, represents a continuation of this tradition. The *gilets jaunes* (yellow vests) can be seen as inheritors of this tradition, expressing anger at economic inequality and a perceived lack of representation.

**8. Key Scholars**

Scholars like Julian Wright and Robert Tombs have provided valuable insights into the history of modern France. Kristin Ross's work on May '68 offers a compelling analysis of its cultural and political legacies. Daniel Singer's account remains a seminal work on the events themselves.

In conclusion, the French working-class ethical tradition is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, shaped by a diverse range of thinkers, movements, and historical events. It is a tradition marked by internal tensions and contradictions, but also by a consistent commitment to social justice, worker autonomy, and the transformation of daily life. This tradition, with its emphasis on the street as a political space, continues to resonate in contemporary France, as evidenced by the *gilets jaunes* movement.

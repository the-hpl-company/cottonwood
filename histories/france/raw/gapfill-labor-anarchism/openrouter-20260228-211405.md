### The French Working-Class Ethical Tradition: From Proudhon to May 1968

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's *What is Property?* (1840) inaugurated a distinctly French working-class ethical tradition with a rhetorical flourish: "Property is theft." As the first self-described anarchist, Proudhon advanced **mutualism** as an ethical economic framework, advocating for workers' self-management, federalism, and anti-statism. His mutualist vision emphasized reciprocity and autonomy, rejecting both capitalist exploitation and state authoritarianism. However, Proudhon's legacy is marred by his **antisemitism** and **misogyny**, which starkly contradict his own ethical ideals. For example, in *La Pornocratie* (1875), he asserted that women were inherently inferior to men—an ethical failure within his own egalitarian framework.

The **Paris Commune (1871)** emerged as a pivotal moment in this tradition, deeply influenced by Proudhonian mutualism, Louis Auguste Blanqui's insurrectionary tactics, and the First International. The Commune's ethical program included workers' control of production, separation of church and state, and universal suffrage. Louise Michel, known as the "Red Virgin," embodied the Commune's ethical spirit, advocating for universal education, women's rights, and solidarity with the oppressed. Her deportation to **New Caledonia** highlights the colonial dimensions of the Commune's aftermath, connecting French revolutionary ethics to the **DOM-TOM** territories.

The rise of **revolutionary syndicalism** marked a new stage in this genealogy. The **Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT)**, founded in 1895, became the institutional expression of this ethos. The **Charter of Amiens (1906)** declared the independence of trade unions from political parties, emphasizing direct action and workers' autonomy. Georges Sorel's *Reflections on Violence* (1908) introduced the **myth of the general strike** as an ethical concept, inspiring workers to imagine a revolutionary rupture. However, Sorel's ideas also revealed tensions between reformist and revolutionary strategies, with some syndicalists embracing gradual change while others sought immediate transformation.

**Jean Jaurès**, founder of *L'Humanité* and leader of the **Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO)**, articulated an ethical case for **democratic socialism**. He sought to reconcile republicanism with socialism, advocating for peaceful reform rather than revolutionary violence. His assassination on **July 31, 1914**, as he attempted to prevent French entry into World War I, represented an **ethical catastrophe**, silencing a voice of moderation and justice.

The **Popular Front (1936)** under Léon Blum embodied the ethics of **anti-fascist coalition**. The **Matignon Accords** institutionalized paid vacations (*congés payés*), the 40-hour workweek, and collective bargaining, framing **leisure as a right**. The **sit-down strikes** demonstrated workers' collective power while underscoring the ethical importance of dignity and autonomy in the workplace.

**May 1968** marked an **ethical rupture**, fusing student activism with worker solidarity. Figures like **Daniel Cohn-Bendit** embodied the era's spirit, with slogans such as "Be realistic, demand the impossible" and "Under the paving stones, the beach" (*Sous les pavés, la plage*) capturing the movement's utopian aspirations. The **general strike**, involving 10 million workers, disrupted the status quo, while the **Grenelle Accords** sought to institutionalize its demands. May '68's ethical legacy includes the transformation of daily life, feminism, sexual liberation, and ecological consciousness. However, critiques persist: did it achieve **structural change**, or was it absorbed into bourgeois liberalism?

### The Genealogy: From Proudhon to the Gilets Jaunes

The French working-class ethical tradition—Proudhon → Commune → CGT → Jaurès → Popular Front → May '68—culminates in the **gilets jaunes** movement. This tradition emphasizes the **street as political space**, with **la manifestation** (the protest) as a democratic practice. The gilets jaunes, with their decentralized, grassroots activism, echo the mutualist and syndicalist ethics of autonomy and solidarity while confronting contemporary inequalities.

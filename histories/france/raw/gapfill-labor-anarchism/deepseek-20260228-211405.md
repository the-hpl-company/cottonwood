### **The French Working-Class Ethical Tradition: From Proudhon to May 1968**

This genealogy traces a distinct ethical current within French social thought, centered on autonomy, direct action, and the moral primacy of labor. It is characterized by a deep tension between libertarian and collectivist impulses, a suspicion of the state and political parties, and a belief in the transformative power of collective self-organization.

#### **1. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: The Foundations of Mutualist Ethics**
The tradition’s foundational text is Pierre-Joseph Proudhon’s *Qu’est-ce que la propriété?* (*What Is Property?*, 1840), where he famously declares, “Property is theft!” (Premier Mémoire, Chapter I). Proudhon, the first to call himself an anarchist, constructed an ethical economics based on **mutualism**: a vision of society organized through free contracts, workers’ associations, and federations of communes, abolishing both capitalist exploitation and state authority. His ethics championed **workers’ self-management** and **federalism** as the antithesis to centralized, hierarchical power.

This ethical framework was sharply contested within the socialist movement itself. Karl Marx’s polemic *Misère de la philosophie* (*The Poverty of Philosophy*, 1847) was a direct response to Proudhon’s *Système des contradictions économiques* (*The System of Economic Contradictions*, 1846). Marx attacked Proudhon’s idealist methodology and his reformist, petty-bourgeois ethics, arguing they failed to grasp the dialectical laws of history and the necessity of proletarian revolution. The Proudhon-Marx split defined a lasting fissure: between a gradualism seeking to build ethical economic relations from below and a revolutionary historicism seeking to seize political power.

This ethical tradition must also confront its profound internal failures. Proudhon’s writings are marred by virulent **antisemitism** (e.g., *Césarisme et Christianisme*, 1883) and **misogyny**, declaring in *La Pornocratie* (1875) that a woman’s worth was as “housewife or courtesan.” These prejudices starkly contradict his own egalitarian and libertarian principles, revealing the limits of his ethical imagination.

#### **2. The Paris Commune (1871): The Ethical Laboratory**
The Commune, while covered elsewhere, is the pivotal *ethical experiment* in this genealogy. Its practical measures were deeply imbued with **Proudhonian mutualism**, as seen in its promotion of workers’ cooperatives to manage abandoned workshops. This ethos coexisted with **Blanquist** insurrectionary tactics and the influence of the International Workingmen’s Association (First International).

The ethical legacy is personified in **Louise Michel**, the “Red Virgin.” Her activism, from the barricades to her deportation trial where she demanded death to join her fallen comrades, embodied a total, self-sacrificing ethical commitment to the commune as an ideal. Her later writings, like *La Commune* (1898), and her advocacy for the Kanak people in New Caledonia during her deportation, extended this ethics of solidarity to the colonized, creating a direct link to later DOM-TOM struggles.

#### **3. Revolutionary Syndicalism and the Charter of Amiens**
The institutionalization of this anti-statist, working-class ethics occurred with the founding of the **Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT)** in 1895. Its defining moment was the **Charter of Amiens (1906)**, which declared the trade union’s complete independence from all political parties. The charter enshrined an ethical doctrine: the union was both the instrument for immediate improvement *and* the “embryo” of a future society based on direct worker management. The union itself became the supreme ethical community.

This was theorized by **Georges Sorel** in *Réflexions sur la violence* (1908). Sorel argued that the **“myth of the general strike”** was not a plan but a mobilizing ethical concept—a catastrophic, polarizing image that could inspire proletarian virtue, heroism, and total rejection of bourgeois decadence. This highlighted the core **tension between reform and revolution**: for revolutionary syndicalists, everyday struggles were ethically valid only if they cultivated class consciousness for the ultimate transformative rupture.

#### **4. Jean Jaurès: The Ethical Synthesis and Its Violent End**
**Jean Jaurès** represented a monumental effort to synthesize this worker-centric ethics with democratic republicanism. As a founder of the newspaper *L’Humanité* (1904) and leader of the French Section of the Workers’ International (SFIO), he made an **ethical case for democratic socialism**. He argued, notably in *L’Armée nouvelle* (1910), that socialism was the fulfillment of the Republic’s ideals, achievable through electoral means and public education, against both bourgeois complacency and Blanquist violence.

His assassination in Paris on **July 31, 1914**, by a nationalist fanatic, was an **ethical catastrophe** for this tradition. Jaurès was the foremost European voice mobilizing workers across borders to prevent war. His death, on the eve of World War I, removed the figure most capable of channeling French socialist ethics into an effective anti-war politics, leading to the SFIO’s tragic support for the *Union Sacrée*.

#### **5. The Popular Front (1936): The Ethics of Anti-Fascism and Leisure**
The **Popular Front**, led by **Léon Blum** of the SFIO, was an **ethical coalition against fascism**, prioritizing democratic defense over socialist purity. Its great ethical achievement came from the massive **sit-down strikes** (*grèves sur le tas*) of May-June 1936, which forced the **Matignon Agreements**. These accords granted the **40-hour week**, **collective bargaining**, and, most lastingly, **paid vacations** (*congés payés*).

This institutionalized an **ethics of leisure as a right**—a revolutionary idea that human dignity required time for self-cultivation outside of work. As historian Julian Wright notes, this was a pivotal moment where working-class power, expressed through direct action, successfully redefined the social contract (*Socialism and the Experience of Time*, 2017).

#### **6. May 1968: The Ethical Rupture**
May ’68 was the explosive re-emergence of the libertarian strand of this genealogy, now fused with new cultural politics. It was an **ethical rupture** that rejected the bureaucratized politics of both the Communist Party and the CGT. The movement, from the student occupation of the Sorbonne to the **general strike of 10 million workers**, was united by slogans like **“Be realistic, demand the impossible”** and **“Under the paving stones, the beach”** (*Sous les pavés, la plage*).

Led by figures like **Daniel Cohn-Bendit**, it championed an ethics of **direct democracy, autonomy, and the transformation of daily life**. The **Grenelle Accords**, which granted substantial wage hikes, were a material victory but were seen by many *enragés* as a betrayal of the broader ethical critique. As Kristin Ross argues, the legacy of May ’68 was the diffusion of its ethical impulses—**feminism, sexual liberation, ecological consciousness, anti-authoritarianism**—into the social fabric, rather than a structural political revolution (*May ’68 and Its Afterlives*, 2002). The critique, articulated by thinkers like Daniel Singer (*Prelude to Revolution*, 1970), is that its refusal of political organization limited its lasting institutional power.

#### **7. The Genealogy: A Tradition of the Street**
The lineage is clear: **Proudhon’s** mutualism → the **Commune’s** direct democracy → the **CGT’s** revolutionary syndicalism → **Jaurès’s** democratic synthesis → the **Popular Front’s** social conquests → **May ’68’s** anti-authoritarian explosion. This tradition has cultivated a uniquely French ethical practice: **the street as political space**. *La manifestation* (the protest) is not merely a tactic but a core democratic ritual, a performative assertion of popular sovereignty against all forms of delegated authority, from the monarchy to the Fifth Republic. This is the essential ethical and tactical groundwork for movements like the **gilets jaunes**, who, while novel in composition, operate within this centuries-old framework of direct, extra-parliamentary expression rooted in a moral economy of work and dignity.

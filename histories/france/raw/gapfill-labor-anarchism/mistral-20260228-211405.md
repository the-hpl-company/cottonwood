### **The French Working-Class Ethical Tradition: From Proudhon to the Gilets Jaunes**

The French working-class ethical tradition is a living, contested genealogy of ideas and practices—mutualism, direct action, federalism, and the sacredness of the street as a site of democratic expression. This tradition is neither linear nor monolithic; it is marked by internal tensions, ethical failures, and moments of radical rupture. Below, we trace its development from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon’s anarchist mutualism to the Gilets Jaunes, emphasizing the philosophical debates, organizational formations, and ethical contradictions that define it.

### **1. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865): Mutualism, Anti-Statism, and Ethical Failures**
Proudhon’s *Qu’est-ce que la propriété?* (*What Is Property?*, 1840) remains the foundational text of French anarchist thought. His famous declaration—*"La propriété, c’est le vol!"* ("Property is theft!")—was not a call for abolition in the Marxist sense but a critique of *unearned* property, particularly rent, interest, and capitalist accumulation. Proudhon’s alternative was **mutualism**: a decentralized, federated system of worker-owned cooperatives, credit unions, and mutual aid societies, operating outside the state.

#### **Key Texts and Ideas:**
- *Système des contradictions économiques, ou Philosophie de la misère* (*System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty*, 1846) – Proudhon’s economic theory, which Marx savagely critiqued in *The Poverty of Philosophy* (1847).
- *De la capacité politique des classes ouvrières* (*On the Political Capacity of the Working Classes*, 1865) – His posthumous call for workers to organize autonomously, without bourgeois or state mediation.
- **Federalism**: Proudhon envisioned a society of self-governing communes and industries, linked by voluntary contracts—a direct precursor to the Paris Commune’s structures.

#### **Ethical Failures:**
Proudhon’s thought was marred by **antisemitism** (*La Juiverie*, 1847) and **misogyny** (*De la justice dans la révolution et dans l’Église*, 1858), where he argued that women were inherently inferior and belonged in the domestic sphere. These contradictions reveal how even radical ethical frameworks can reproduce oppressive hierarchies.

#### **The Proudhon-Marx Debate:**
Marx’s *The Poverty of Philosophy* (1847) dismissed Proudhon’s mutualism as utopian, arguing that only class struggle and revolutionary seizure of the state could abolish capitalism. Proudhon, in turn, rejected Marx’s authoritarianism, warning in *La Solution du problème social* (1848) that state socialism would lead to tyranny. This debate prefigured the later split between anarchist and Marxist wings of the First International (1864–1876).

### **2. The Paris Commune (1871): Proudhonian Mutualism in Practice**
The Commune was the first large-scale attempt to implement Proudhon’s federalist and mutualist principles. While the main page covers its events, its **ethical genealogy** must be emphasized:

#### **Roots in Proudhon and the First International:**
- The **Central Committee of the National Guard** (a workers’ militia) and the **Commune’s Council** operated on **direct democracy**, with recallable delegates and federated neighborhood assemblies.
- The **decree on workshops** (April 16, 1871) mandated that abandoned factories be turned over to worker cooperatives—a direct application of Proudhon’s mutualism.
- The **separation of church and state** (April 2, 1871) and the **abolition of night work for bakers** (April 20, 1871) reflected the Commune’s ethical commitment to secularism and labor rights.

#### **Louise Michel: The "Red Virgin" and Ethical Legacy**
- A schoolteacher and anarchist, Michel became a symbol of the Commune’s radical egalitarianism. Her memoir, *La Commune* (1898), framed the uprising as a moral crusade against oppression.
- After the Commune’s defeat, she was deported to **New Caledonia** (1873–1880), where she supported the Kanak independence movement—a connection to France’s colonial ethical failures in the DOM-TOM.

#### **Blanquism and Insurrectionary Tradition:**
- Auguste Blanqui’s *L’Éternité par les astres* (1872) argued that revolutionary violence was necessary to break the state. While Proudhon rejected Blanqui’s vanguardism, the Commune synthesized both traditions: mutualist self-management *and* insurrectionary defense.

### **3. Revolutionary Syndicalism: The CGT and the Myth of the General Strike**
The **Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT)**, founded in 1895, became the institutional home of **revolutionary syndicalism**—a uniquely French fusion of anarchism, socialism, and trade unionism.

#### **The Charter of Amiens (1906): Trade Union Independence**
- Adopted at the CGT’s 9th Congress, the **Charter of Amiens** declared:
  > *"The CGT groups, outside all political schools, all workers conscious of the struggle to be waged for the disappearance of wage labor and employers."*
- This **anti-statist, anti-party** stance reflected Proudhon’s influence and rejected both parliamentary socialism and bourgeois republicanism.

#### **Georges Sorel: The Ethical Myth of Violence**
- *Réflexions sur la violence* (*Reflections on Violence*, 1908) argued that the **general strike** was not a tactical tool but a **myth**—a mobilizing ethical vision that could inspire workers to revolutionary action.
- Sorel’s thought was ambiguous: he admired both Lenin and Mussolini, revealing the dangerous proximity of revolutionary syndicalism to authoritarianism.

#### **Tensions: Reform vs. Revolution**
- The CGT split in 1921, with reformists (led by Léon Jouhaux) advocating gradualism, while revolutionaries (led by Pierre Monatte) clung to the general strike myth.
- The **1907 winegrowers’ revolt** in Languedoc showed the power of direct action, but also the limits of syndicalism without political alliances.

### **4. Jean Jaurès (1859–1914): Democratic Socialism and Ethical Humanism**
Jaurès, founder of *L’Humanité* (1904) and leader of the **Section Française de l’Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO)**, offered a **republican socialist** alternative to both revolutionary syndicalism and bourgeois liberalism.

#### **Key Texts and Ideas:**
- *Les Preuves* (*The Proofs*, 1900) – A defense of Alfred Dreyfus, framing justice as a socialist ethical imperative.
- *L’Armée nouvelle* (*The New Army*, 1910) – Argued for a **citizen militia** to replace the standing army, linking antimilitarism to democracy.
- *Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française* (1901–1908) – Reclaimed the French Revolution’s radical legacy for socialism.

#### **The Ethical Case Against Violence:**
Jaurès opposed Sorel’s glorification of violence, arguing in *Discours à la jeunesse* (1903) that socialism must be achieved through **moral persuasion and democratic struggle**.

#### **Assassination (July 31, 1914): An Ethical Catastrophe**
- Jaurès was murdered by a nationalist fanatic on the eve of WWI. His death symbolized the **failure of internationalism** and the **triumph of militarism**.
- As Julian Wright (*The Regionalist Movement in France*, 2003) notes, Jaurès’ absence left the SFIO leaderless, paving the way for the **Union Sacrée** (1914) and France’s entry into war.

### **5. The Popular Front (1936): Anti-Fascism and the Ethics of Leisure**
The **Popular Front** (1936–1938), led by **Léon Blum**, was the first left-wing government in French history. Its ethical achievements were profound, but so were its limitations.

#### **The Matignon Accords (June 7, 1936): Labor Rights as Ethical Victories**
- **40-hour workweek**
- **Paid vacation (congés payés)** – For the first time, workers had the **right to leisure**, a radical redefinition of human dignity.
- **Collective bargaining** – Unions gained legal recognition.

#### **The Sit-Down Strikes: Direct Action Meets Reform**
- Over **2 million workers** occupied factories in May–June 1936, forcing Blum’s government to act.
- The strikes were **both a victory and a warning**: they showed the power of direct action, but also the limits of reform within capitalism.

#### **Ethical Failures: Colonialism and Exclusion**
- The Popular Front **did not extend rights to colonial subjects** (e.g., the **1936–38 revolts in Syria and Lebanon** were brutally suppressed).
- Blum’s government **excluded women** from key reforms, reflecting the SFIO’s patriarchal structures.

### **6. May 1968: The Ethical Rupture of Daily Life**
May ’68 was not just a political event but an **ethical explosion**—a rejection of authoritarianism in the workplace, the family, and the university.

#### **Key Events and Slogans:**
- **March 22 Movement (Nanterre)**: Students occupied the university, demanding **sexual liberation** and **anti-authoritarian education**.
- **Night of the Barricades (May 10–11)**: The Latin Quarter became a **liberated zone**, with the slogan *"Sous les pavés, la plage!"* ("Under the cobblestones, the beach") evoking both revolution and utopia.
- **General Strike (10 million workers)**: The largest strike in French history, with workers occupying factories and demanding **autogestion** (self-management).

#### **The Grenelle Accords (May 27, 1968): A Pyrrhic Victory**
- Wage increases (10%) and union rights were won, but the **revolutionary moment passed**.
- De Gaulle’s **June 1968 elections** restored order, but the **cultural shift** was irreversible.

#### **Ethical Legacies and Critiques:**
- **Feminism**: The **Mouvement de Libération des Femmes (MLF)** emerged in 1970, radicalizing the demand for bodily autonomy.
- **Ecology**: The **Larzac struggle (1971–1981)** and *Le Sauvage* magazine (1973) linked anti-capitalism to environmentalism.
- **Critiques**: Daniel Cohn-Bendit (*Obsolete Communism: The Left-Wing Alternative*, 1968) argued that ’68 failed to dismantle capitalism. Kristin Ross (*May ’68 and Its Afterlives*, 2002) counters that its **cultural impact**—the transformation of daily life—was its true victory.

### **7. The Genealogy: From Proudhon to the Gilets Jaunes**
The French working-class ethical tradition is a **living genealogy**, not a museum piece. Its key threads:
1. **Anti-statism** (Proudhon → CGT → ’68 → Gilets Jaunes)
2. **Direct action** (Commune → CGT strikes → ’68 → Gilets Jaunes blockades)
3. **Federalism** (Proudhon’s mutualism → Commune’s decentralization → ’68’s autogestion → Gilets Jaunes’ local assemblies)
4. **The street as political space** (*la manifestation* as democratic practice)

#### **The Gilets Jaunes (2018–2019): A Return to the Proudhonian Tradition?**
- **Decentralized, leaderless** – No unions or parties, just **local assemblies** (e.g., Commercy’s "Assembly of Assemblies").
- **Anti-tax, anti-elite** – A **mutualist** rejection of state redistribution in favor of **direct economic justice**.
- **Ethical contradictions**: Some factions embraced **antisemitism** and **conspiracy theories**, echoing Proudhon’s darker legacy.

### **Conclusion: A Tradition of Ethical Tension**
The French working-class ethical tradition is **not a single doctrine but a field of struggle**—between reform and revolution, mutualism and statism, inclusion and exclusion. Its greatest strength is its **refusal of dogma**; its greatest weakness is its **tendency toward fragmentation**. From Proudhon’s mutualism to the Gilets Jaunes’ roundabouts, it remains a **living, breathing challenge** to the ethics of capital and the state.

# The Ethical Foundations of France, c. 400–1400 CE

## 1. The Frankish Synthesis: Warrior Ethos and Catholic Moral Theology
The conversion of **Clovis I (c. 466–511)** at Reims (496, per Gregory of Tours’ *Historia Francorum*) marked a foundational ethical fusion. Germanic *comitatus* loyalty (the warrior band’s reciprocal oath) merged with Augustinian notions of **divine grace and earthly authority**. The **Salic Law (*Pactus Legis Salicae*, c. 500–511)** is not merely a penal code but an ethical document encoding **weregild** (monetary compensation for harm) as a substitute for vendetta, establishing a hierarchy of human value—e.g., 200 solidi for killing a free Frank versus 600 for a *trustis dominica* (royal servant). Merovingian governance, per **Marc Bloch’s *Feudal Society* (1939)**, embedded a **personal, oath-based ethics** rather than Roman abstract legality. Carolingian reforms under **Charlemagne (768–814)** systematized this via the **Admonitio Generalis (789)**, which mandated bishops to oversee public morality, blending **canon law with royal capitularies**. The ethical framework is **hierarchical and sacral**: the king is *rex et sacerdos*, responsible for the *salus populi* (spiritual and temporal welfare).

## 2. Charlemagne and the Carolingian Renaissance: The Christian King as Ethical Guarantor
The **Palace School** under **Alcuin of York (c. 735–804)** promoted a **Neoplatonic ethical pedagogy** aimed at forming a Christian ruling class. Alcuin’s *De virtutibus et vitiis* (c. 800) framed virtues as **habits of the soul** directed toward divine order. Charlemagne’s **Admonitio Generalis** ordered priests to establish schools, preach against perjury, adultery, and violence—imposing a **universalizing Christian ethic** atop local custom. Unlike the Byzantine *basileus* (emperor as God’s viceroy in a caesaropapist model) or the Islamic *caliph* (successor to Muhammad’s political-religious authority), the Carolingian king derived legitimacy from **coronation and papal sanction** (Charlemagne crowned Emperor in 800) but held **independent responsibility for moral order**. The **Libri Carolini (790s)**, rejecting Byzantine iconoclasm, asserted Frankish ethical autonomy from Constantinople.

## 3. The Peace of God (*Pax Dei*) and Truce of God (*Treuga Dei*): Ecclesiastical Constraints on Feudal Violence
Initiated at the **Synod of Charroux (989)**, the Peace of God protected **non-combatants** (clerics, peasants, merchants) and church property. The **Truce of God**, from the Synod of Elne (1027), prohibited violence from Thursday to Sunday. These movements, analyzed by **Georges Duby in *The Three Orders* (1978)**, encoded a **tripartite ethical schema**: *oratores* (those who pray), *bellatores* (those who fight), *laboratores* (those who work). Effectiveness was partial but real: **oaths sworn on relics** by knights, with excommunication as sanction. The ethical framework is **ecclesiastical pacification**—violence is legitimate only when directed by the Church (e.g., crusades) or for protecting the weak. The **Peace of God** established the **Church as arbiter of feudal ethics**, a precursor to later royal monopoly on violence.

## 4. The University of Paris and Scholasticism: Systematic Ethical Reasoning
**Peter Abelard (1079–1142)** in *Sic et Non* (c. 1122) applied dialectic to ethical questions, arguing in *Ethica or Scito Teipsum* (c. 1138) that **moral intention (*intentio*)** determines an act’s value, not the external deed—a shift toward **subjective conscience**. **Peter Lombard’s *Sentences* (1150)** became the standard theological textbook, organizing ethical dilemmas around charity (*caritas*) as the supreme virtue. The **Victorines** (Hugh and Richard of St. Victor) at the Abbey of St. Victor in Paris emphasized **mystical ethics**—ascent to God through contemplation and moral purification. This Parisian milieu, per **Étienne Gilson’s *History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages* (1955)**, made ethics a **systematic discipline** grounded in rational inquiry, distinct from monastic asceticism.

## 5. Thomas Aquinas at Paris: Natural Law and the Common Good
**Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)** taught at Paris (1256–1259, 1269–1272). His *Summa Theologica* (1265–1274) **I-II, qq. 90–97** articulates **natural law (*lex naturalis*)** as rational participation in eternal law, accessible to all humans. Key ethical contributions:
- **Just war doctrine** (*ST* II-II, q. 40): right intention, legitimate authority, just cause.
- **Double effect** (implicit in *ST* II-II, q. 64, a. 7): an act with good and bad effects is permissible if the intention is good, the bad effect is not the means, and proportionality exists.
- **Common good (*bonum commune*)** as the end of law (*ST* I-II, q. 90, a. 2).
Aquinas synthesized **Aristotelian *Nicomachean Ethics*** (via Albertus Magnus) with Augustinianism, creating a **virtue ethics** where prudence directs natural inclinations toward happiness (*beatitudo*). This became the **dominant ethical framework** for French Catholicism.

## 6. The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade: Ethics of Heresy Suppression
The **Cathar *perfecti*** in Languedoc practiced ascetic dualism, rejecting material creation as evil—a direct challenge to Catholic sacramental ethics. Pope Innocent III’s call for crusade (1209) and the **Council of Toulouse (1229)** instituted systematic persecution. The **Inquisition in Languedoc** (established 1233) under Dominican friars like **Bernard Gui** (author of *Practica Inquisitionis*, c. 1323) operationalized an **ethics of orthodoxy**: error has no rights, and coercive conversion is charitable (*compelle intrare*, Luke 14:23). Destroyed were **Occitan ethical traditions** of toleration (Jewish-Cathar coexistence) and vernacular courtly love ethics (*fin’amor*). The **Treaty of Paris (1229)** annexed Languedoc to the French crown, imposing **northern feudal Catholicism** as the normative ethic.

## 7. Joan of Arc: Conscience Against Institutional Authority
**Joan’s trial (1431)** at Rouen, recorded in the *Procès de condamnation*, is an ethical clash between **ecclesiastical authority** (the tribunal led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon) and **personal revelation** (Joan’s “voices” from St. Michael, Catherine, Margaret). Joan appealed to **a higher divine mandate** than the Church militant: “I submit to God, who sent me.” Her **rehabilitation trial (1456)**, ordered by Charles VII, canonized her as a **national martyr**, embedding in French ethics the **right of conscience** against corrupt institutions. Per **Jacques Le Goff’s *Saint Louis* (1996)**, Joan symbolizes the **sovereign individual** whose virtue transcends feudal and clerical hierarchies—a precursor to modern French *laïcité* and republican conscience.

## 8. Synthesis: French Ethical Foundations to 1400
The medieval period established enduring tensions:
- **Universal Catholic ethic vs. Frankish particularism** (Salic Law).
- **Ecclesiastical pacification vs. royal justice** (Peace of God to Aquinas’s common good).
- **Scholastic rational ethics vs. mystical conscience** (Abelard to Joan).
- **Orthodox coercion vs. heterodox resistance** (Albigensian Crusade).

These foundations would be contested in the Renaissance, Reformation, and Revolution, but the **dialectic of universal claim and particular exclusion**—already visible in Charlemagne’s forced baptisms and the Inquisition’s logic—became a defining feature of French ethical history.

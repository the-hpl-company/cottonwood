### **Ethical Foundations of France: Gallo-Roman Christianity to the Late Medieval Period (c. 400–1400 CE)**

France’s ethical tradition emerges from the collision and synthesis of **Gallo-Roman Christianity, Frankish warrior culture, and medieval scholasticism**, producing a framework that oscillates between **universal moral claims (Catholic natural law, the common good) and particularist exclusions (feudal violence, heresy suppression, gendered hierarchies)**. Below, we trace this evolution through key texts, institutions, and conflicts.

## **1. The Frankish Synthesis: Clovis’s Conversion (496) and the Salic Law as Ethical Document**

### **Clovis’s Conversion (496) and the Fusion of Germanic and Christian Ethics**
The baptism of **Clovis I (r. 481–511)**, king of the Franks, at **Reims (496, traditionally dated)** marked the first major synthesis of **Germanic warrior ethics** and **Catholic moral theology**. Unlike the Arian Visigoths or Ostrogoths, Clovis adopted **Nicene Christianity**, aligning his kingdom with the **Papacy and the Roman Church** (Gregory of Tours, *Historia Francorum*, II.31, c. 590).

- **Germanic Warrior Ethics**: The Franks operated under a **comitatus** (warrior-band) ethos, where loyalty to the king was paramount, and vengeance (*faida*) was a legitimate response to injury (Tacitus, *Germania*, 1st c. CE).
- **Christian Moral Theology**: The Church introduced **penitential ethics** (confession, atonement) and **charity** (care for the poor, widows, orphans) as counterweights to blood feuds.

**Key Tension**: The Franks retained **trial by ordeal** (e.g., hot iron, cold water) as a divine judgment, while the Church sought to replace it with **rational legal procedures** (Council of Valence, 855).

### **The Salic Law (Lex Salica, c. 507–511) as Ethical Framework**
The **Salic Law**, codified under Clovis, was not merely a legal text but an **ethical document** that:
- **Regulated vengeance**: Blood feuds were limited by **wergild** (compensation payments), replacing unlimited retaliation with a **monetary system of justice** (Salic Law, Tit. 41).
- **Protected property and inheritance**: Excluded women from land inheritance (*terra salica*), reinforcing **patriarchal control** (Tit. 59).
- **Defined crimes against the community**: Theft, murder, and treason were punished with fines or exile, not just private vengeance.

**Ethical Implications**:
- **Restorative justice** (wergild) over retributive justice (blood feud).
- **Hierarchy and exclusion**: Women, slaves, and non-Franks (e.g., Romans) had fewer rights.
- **Church influence**: Later revisions (e.g., *Lex Salica Emendata*, 8th c.) incorporated **Christian penalties** (e.g., penance for perjury).

**Scholars**:
- **Georges Duby** (*The Early Growth of the European Economy*, 1973) – Frankish law as a **negotiation between Germanic custom and Christian morality**.
- **Marc Bloch** (*Feudal Society*, 1939) – The Salic Law as a **transitional document** between tribal and feudal ethics.

## **2. Charlemagne and the Carolingian Renaissance: The Admonitio Generalis (789) and the Christian King as Ethical Guarantor**

### **The Admonitio Generalis (789) as Ethical Legislation**
Charlemagne’s **Admonitio Generalis** (789) was a **moral and educational reform** that sought to **Christianize Frankish society** by:
- **Standardizing liturgy** (Roman Rite over Gallican).
- **Mandating clerical education** (every cathedral and monastery must have a school).
- **Enforcing moral discipline**: Bishops were to **preach against usury, incest, and pagan superstitions** (Admonitio, c. 62–63).

**Key Ethical Principles**:
1. **The King as Vicar of God**: Charlemagne saw himself as **responsible for the souls of his subjects** (cf. *Divisio Regnorum*, 806).
2. **Education as Moral Formation**: The **Palace School** (under **Alcuin of York**, d. 804) trained clergy and nobles in **grammar, rhetoric, and theology** to produce **virtuous rulers**.
3. **The Common Good**: The **Capitulary of Herstal (779)** required lords to **protect the poor and widows** (c. 16).

**Alcuin’s Influence**:
- **De Virtutibus et Vitiis** (c. 799–800): A **mirror for princes** outlining the **seven virtues** (faith, hope, charity, prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude) and **seven vices** (pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, gluttony, lust).
- **Ethics of Obedience**: Alcuin argued that **rebellion against a just king was a sin** (*Epistolae*, 136).

**Comparison with Byzantine and Islamic Ethics**:
- **Byzantine**: The **Ecloga (726)** under Leo III emphasized **imperial justice** but retained **corporal and capital punishment** (e.g., mutilation for theft).
- **Islamic**: The **Abbasid Caliphate (8th–9th c.)** under **Al-Ma’mun** promoted **rationalist ethics** (Mu’tazilism), while **Sharia law** regulated personal and communal life.
- **Carolingian Difference**: Charlemagne’s ethics were **pastoral and educational**, not just legal. The **Admonitio** sought **moral reform from within**, not just punishment.

**Scholars**:
- **Etienne Gilson** (*The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy*, 1932) – Carolingian ethics as a **fusion of Augustinian theology and Roman law**.
- **Jacques Le Goff** (*Intellectuals in the Middle Ages*, 1957) – The **Palace School as the birth of a European intellectual elite**.

## **3. The Peace of God and Truce of God (10th–11th c.): The Church’s Ethical Constraints on Feudal Violence**

### **The Synod of Charroux (989) and the Peace of God**
By the **10th century**, feudal anarchy (private wars, knightly violence) threatened the Church and peasantry. The **Peace of God (Pax Dei)** movement emerged as an **ethical intervention**:
- **Synod of Charroux (989)**: Bishops declared **excommunication for those who harmed clerics, peasants, or church property** (Canon 1).
- **Synod of Le Puy (990)**: Extended protection to **merchants and women**.
- **Truce of God (Treuga Dei, 1027)**: Banned warfare from **Wednesday evening to Monday morning** (later extended to **Advent and Lent**).

**Ethical Framework**:
1. **Sacralization of the Vulnerable**: The Church **redefined who was worthy of protection** (clerics, peasants, women) against **feudal predation**.
2. **Divine Sanction**: Violence against the defenseless was **not just illegal but sinful**.
3. **Limits of Effectiveness**: The Peace of God **failed to end feudal warfare** but **created a moral discourse** that later influenced **chivalric ethics** (e.g., the **Song of Roland**, c. 1100).

**Scholars**:
- **Georges Duby** (*The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined*, 1978) – The Peace of God as an **attempt to impose Christian ethics on warrior culture**.
- **Marc Bloch** (*Feudal Society*) – The **Truce of God as a precursor to modern humanitarian law**.

## **4. The University of Paris and Scholastic Ethics: Abelard, Lombard, and the Victorines**

### **Peter Abelard (1079–1142): The Ethics of Intention**
Abelard’s **Ethica (Scito Te Ipsum, c. 1138)** argued that **moral responsibility depends on intention, not consequences**:
- **"Sin is contempt of God"** (Ethica, I.1) – An act is evil only if done **knowingly and willingly**.
- **Implications**:
  - **Subjective morality**: A well-intentioned act (e.g., giving alms for vainglory) is still sinful.
  - **Challenge to legalism**: The Church’s **penitential system** (fixed tariffs for sins) was **inadequate** if intention mattered more than the act.

**Sic et Non (1120s)**: Abelard’s **dialectical method** (juxtaposing contradictory authorities) became the **foundation of scholastic ethics**.

### **Peter Lombard (c. 1100–1160): The Sentences and Systematic Ethics**
Lombard’s **Libri Quatuor Sententiarum (1155–1158)** became the **standard theology textbook** of the Middle Ages, structuring ethics around:
1. **God** (the source of morality).
2. **Creation** (human nature and free will).
3. **Christ** (the model of virtue).
4. **Sacraments** (the means of grace).

**Key Ethical Concepts**:
- **Natural Law**: Humans can **reason to moral truths** (e.g., "Do good, avoid evil").
- **Theological Virtues**: Faith, hope, charity as **divinely infused** (not just acquired).

### **The Victorines (12th c.): Mysticism and Ethics**
The **Abbey of St. Victor** (Paris) produced **Hugh of St. Victor (d. 1141)** and **Richard of St. Victor (d. 1173)**, who blended **mysticism and ethics**:
- **Hugh of St. Victor, De Sacramentis (1130–1140)**: Ethics as **preparation for contemplation**.
- **Richard of St. Victor, The Four Degrees of Violent Charity (1170s)**: Love as the **highest ethical principle**.

**Scholars**:
- **Etienne Gilson** (*History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages*, 1955) – Scholasticism as the **birth of systematic ethics in Europe**.
- **Jacques Le Goff** (*The Intellectuals in the Middle Ages*) – The **University of Paris as a site of ethical debate**.

## **5. Thomas Aquinas at Paris: Natural Law and the Common Good**

### **Summa Theologica (1265–1274) and Natural Law**
Aquinas, an **Italian Dominican**, developed his ethics at the **University of Paris (1252–1259, 1269–1272)**. His **Summa Theologica** synthesized **Aristotelian ethics** with **Christian theology**:
- **Natural Law (I-II, Q. 94)**: Humans participate in **eternal law** through reason. The **first precept**: "Good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided."
- **The Common Good (II-II, Q. 58)**: Justice is **rendering to each their due**, but **the common good takes precedence over individual rights**.
- **Just War Doctrine (II-II, Q. 40)**:
  - **Legitimate authority** (only a sovereign can wage war).
  - **Just cause** (e.g., defense, recovery of stolen goods).
  - **Right intention** (not vengeance or greed).
- **Double Effect (I-II, Q. 64, Art. 7)**: An act with **both good and bad effects** is permissible if:
  - The act itself is good or neutral.
  - The bad effect is not intended.
  - The good effect outweighs the bad.

**Ethical Implications**:
- **Hierarchy of Laws**: Divine law > Natural law > Human law.
- **Limits of Obedience**: A law that **contradicts natural law** (e.g., tyranny) is **not binding**.
- **Property and Charity**: Private property is **permissible**, but **superfluous wealth must be shared** (II-II, Q. 66).

**Scholars**:
- **Etienne Gilson** (*The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas*, 1956) – Aquinas as the **culmination of medieval ethical thought**.
- **Alasdair MacIntyre** (*After Virtue*, 1981) – Aquinas as a **bridge between Aristotelian and modern ethics**.

## **6. The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229): The Ethics of Heresy Suppression**

### **The Cathar Heresy and the Church’s Response**
The **Cathars (Albigensians)** of **Languedoc** (12th–13th c.) were **dualists**, believing in:
- A **good God (spiritual world)** and an **evil God (material world)**.
- **Rejection of the sacraments, the Church hierarchy, and procreation** (seen as trapping souls in matter).

**The Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229)**:
- **Pope Innocent III** declared a **crusade against heretics** (1208).
- **Massacre at Béziers (1209)**: "Kill them all, God will know His own" (attributed to **Arnald-Amaury**, papal legate).
- **Inquisition in Languedoc (1233)**: **Bernard of Caux** and **Jean de St-Pierre** used **torture and forced confessions** to root out heresy.

**Ethical Traditions Destroyed**:
1. **Toleration**: The Cathars **rejected coercion in matters of faith** (cf. **Durandus of Huesca**, a Cathar convert who later wrote against forced conversion).
2. **Gender Equality**: Cathar **perfectae (female ascetics)** had **equal spiritual authority** to men.
3. **Anti-Materialism**: The Cathars **rejected feudal wealth**, seeing it as **sinful**.

**Legacy**:
- **First systematic persecution of heretics in Europe**.
- **Precedent for later witch hunts and religious wars**.

**Scholars**:
- **Mark Gregory Pegg** (*The Corruption of Angels*, 2001) – The Albigensian Crusade as **genocide**.
- **R.I. Moore** (*The Formation of a Persecuting Society*, 1987) – The **birth of the "heretic" as a category of exclusion**.

## **7. Joan of Arc (1431): Conscience Against Institutional Authority**

### **The Trial of Joan of Arc (1431) as Ethical Document**
Joan’s **trial at Rouen (1431)** was a **clash between individual conscience and institutional authority**:
- **Accusations**: Heresy, witchcraft, cross-dressing (a "crime against nature").
- **Joan’s Defense**:
  - **"I was admonished by my voices"** (St. Michael, St. Catherine, St. Margaret).
  - **"If I am not in a state of grace, may God put me there; if I am, may He keep me so."** (Trial records, Feb. 25, 1431).
- **Condemnation**: Burned as a **relapsed heretic** (May 30, 1431).

### **The Rehabilitation Trial (1456)**
- **Pope Callixtus III** overturned the verdict, declaring Joan **innocent**.
- **Ethical Implications**:
  - **Conscience over authority**: Joan’s **voices** were later **canonized as divine revelation**.
  - **Gender and prophecy**: Joan **challenged medieval misogyny** (cf. **Christine de Pizan’s *Ditié de Jehanne d’Arc*, 1429**).
  - **National myth**: Joan became a **symbol of French resistance** (later **secularized by the Revolution**).

**Scholars**:
- **Colette Beaune** (*Joan of Arc: Her Story*, 1994) – Joan as a **figure of female agency in a patriarchal Church**.
- **Jules Michelet** (*History of France*, 1840s) – Joan as the **embodiment of the French nation**.

## **Conclusion: The Medieval Ethical Tradition in France**

France’s medieval ethical tradition is defined by **three key tensions**:

1. **Universalism vs. Exclusion**:
   - **Universal claims**: Natural law (Aquinas), the common good (Charlemagne), the Peace of God.
   - **Exclusions**: Women (Salic Law), heretics (Albigensian Crusade), non-Christians (later anti-Jewish expulsions).

2. **Church vs. State**:
   - **Theocratic ethics**: The king as **God’s vicar** (Carolingians).
   - **Secular resistance**: Joan of Arc’s **conscience against the Church**.

3. **Violence vs. Care**:
   - **Feudal violence** (blood feuds, knightly raids).
   - **Church interventions** (Peace of God, penitential ethics).

The French Enlightenment (1650-1789) represents a seismic shift in ethical thought, characterized by profound tensions between reason and feeling, universalism and particularism, and authority and liberty. Below, I trace the key ethical innovations of this period, grounded in specific texts and thinkers, while highlighting the internal contradictions that define this tradition.

### 1. **René Descartes (1596-1650)**  
**Works:** *Discourse on Method* (1637), *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641).  
Descartes’ methodological skepticism, epitomized by *cogito, ergo sum* (“I think, therefore I am”), reshaped French ethical thought by anchoring certainty in the individual rational subject. This epistemological individualism had profound ethical implications: if truth begins with the thinking self, communal ethical obligations must be rationally justified rather than passively inherited. In *Discourse on Method*, Descartes writes: “I thought it necessary to demolish everything completely and start again right from the foundations” (Part II). This systematic doubt becomes an ethical discipline, challenging dogma and authority. However, the Cartesian model risks solipsism—how does the isolated *cogito* engage in communal moral reasoning? This tension between rational autonomy and ethical obligation remains central to French thought.

### 2. **Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)**  
**Works:** *Pensées* (1670), *Provincial Letters* (1656-57).  
Pascal’s ethical thought emerges as a counterpoint to Descartes. In *Pensées*, he famously states: “The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of” (Fragment 423). Here, Pascal critiques the limits of rationalist ethics, emphasizing intuition and faith. His “wager” argument—that belief in God is the most rational ethical choice even in the absence of proof—frames ethics as a probabilistic calculation. In the *Provincial Letters*, Pascal attacks Jesuit casuistry for its moral laxity, advocating instead for rigorous ethical integrity. This tension between Cartesian rationalism and Pascalian intuition defines the French Enlightenment’s ethical landscape.

### 3. **Montesquieu (1689-1755)**  
**Works:** *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748), *Persian Letters* (1721).  
Montesquieu’s ethical vision centers on institutional design. In *The Spirit of the Laws*, he argues that laws must reflect the “general spirit” of a society, shaped by climate, religion, and customs. His advocacy for the separation of powers—legislative, executive, and judicial—becomes an ethical architecture to prevent tyranny. In *Persian Letters*, he employs satire to critique French society through the eyes of fictional Persian visitors, defamiliarizing European norms and exposing their ethical failings. Montesquieu’s influence on the American Founders (e.g., Madison in *Federalist Papers* No. 47) underscores the transnational impact of his ethical thought.

### 4. **Voltaire (1694-1778)**  
**Works:** *Candide* (1759), *Treatise on Tolerance* (1763), *Philosophical Dictionary* (1764).  
Voltaire’s ethics are grounded in satire and activism. In *Candide*, he lampoons Leibnizian optimism (“All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds”) through the misfortunes of his protagonist, advocating instead for pragmatic action to alleviate suffering. In *Treatise on Tolerance*, inspired by the Calas Affair (1762), he defends religious freedom and condemns judicial cruelty. However, Voltaire’s ethical vision is marred by his antisemitism, as seen in his *Philosophical Dictionary* entry on Jews. His rallying cry “Écrasez l’infâme” (“Crush the infamous thing”) epitomizes the Enlightenment’s ethical imperative to dismantle oppressive institutions.

### 5. **Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)**  
**Works:** *Discourse on Inequality* (1755), *The Social Contract* (1762), *Emile* (1762).  
Rousseau’s ethics pivot on the tension between natural goodness and social corruption. In *Discourse on Inequality*, he argues that societal institutions create moral decay: “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.” *The Social Contract* proposes the “general will” as the foundation of ethical sovereignty, where individuals willingly subordinate their private interests to the common good. Yet Rousseau’s abandonment of his own children starkly contradicts his ethical ideals, embodying the Enlightenment’s biographical hypocrisies. His clash with Voltaire—Rousseau’s emphasis on virtue vs. Voltaire’s focus on reason—captures two distinct ethical visions that both fuel the Revolution.

### 6. **Denis Diderot (1713-1784)**  
**Works:** *Encyclopédie* (1751-1772), *Supplement to Bougainville’s Voyage* (1772), *Rameau’s Nephew* (1762).  
Diderot’s monumental *Encyclopédie* epitomizes the Enlightenment’s ethical project: democratizing knowledge to empower individuals. In *Supplement to Bougainville’s Voyage*, he critiques European colonialism through Tahitian perspectives, arguing that morality is culturally contingent. *Rameau’s Nephew*, a dialogue on hypocrisy and authenticity, explores the ethical ambiguities of modern life. Diderot’s work underscores the politics of knowledge as an ethical question.

### 7. **Condorcet (1743-1794)**  
**Work:** *Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind* (1795).  
Condorcet’s unfinished magnum opus, written while hiding from the Jacobins, embodies the Enlightenment’s ethical optimism. He envisions a future of universal education and equality, driven by reason and progress: “The time will come when the sun will shine only on free men.” Condorcet’s belief in human perfectibility, articulated under death sentence, exemplifies the Enlightenment’s ethical resilience.

### Key Tensions and Legacies  
The French Enlightenment’s ethical innovations are defined by tensions:  
- **Rationalism vs. Intuition:** Descartes vs. Pascal.  
- **Universalism vs. Particularism:** Voltaire’s cosmopolitanism vs. Rousseau’s communitarianism.  
- **Optimism vs. Cynicism:** Condorcet’s progressivism vs. Diderot’s skepticism.  

These contradictions shape not only the French Revolution but also modern ethical thought. As Jonathan Israel argues in *Radical Enlightenment* (2001), the Enlightenment’s legacy lies in its relentless questioning of authority—a stance rooted in Descartes’ methodological doubt but complicated by Pascal’s appeal to the heart.

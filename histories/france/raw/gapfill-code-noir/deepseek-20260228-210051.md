## The *Code Noir* (1685): Legal Theology and Colonial Atrocity

### 1. The Text: A Close Reading of the 1685 Edict
Promulgated by Louis XIV in March 1685, the *Code Noir* (*Edit du Roi, Touchant la Police des Isles de l’Amérique Française*) is a 60-article royal edict that constitutes the foundational legal-ethical framework for chattel slavery in the French empire. Its provisions reveal a systematic attempt to regulate a system of absolute domination through a lens of Catholic paternalism.

*   **Article 2:** Orders the expulsion of all Jews from French colonies and mandates that all enslaved people be baptized and instructed in the Catholic religion. This establishes the core contradiction: the enslaved is simultaneously a soul to be saved (and thus subject to the Church’s authority) and a piece of property.
*   **Article 6:** Forbids work on Sundays and Catholic holidays, a provision rooted in canon law. In practice, this was widely ignored by planters, but it created a theoretical space—and a frequent legal complaint by colonial administrators—that acknowledged the enslaved person’s humanity within a religious, not civil, framework.
*   **Article 22:** Obligates masters to provide food and clothing (*habits*) to enslaved people. This created a minimal standard of "care" but framed it as a maintenance cost for property, not a human right. Enforcement was notoriously weak.
*   **Article 28:** Declares that enslaved people "shall be incapable of owning anything," and anything they acquire belongs to their master. This legal nullification of personhood—the inability to hold property—was central to their status as *meubles* (movable property) under **Article 44**.
*   **Article 33:** Prescribes death for an enslaved person who strikes their master, mistress, or their children. The violence of the system is laid bare: any act of self-defense against the master’s absolute authority is a capital crime.
*   **Article 38:** Defines the *marron* (fugitive slave). For a first escape of one month, the punishment is ear-cutting and branding; a second escape merits hamstringing; a third merits execution. This codifies a regime of escalating, mutilating terror to enforce submission.
*   **Article 55:** Provides a pathway to manumission, but only with the master’s consent. This created the class of *gens de couleur libres* (free people of color), a buffer class whose existence was meant to stabilize the system, not undermine it.

### 2. The Ethical Logic: Property and Soul
The *Code Noir*’s ethical logic is a product of **Absolutist Gallican Catholicism**. It attempts to reconcile two incompatible principles: Roman law concepts of absolute property rights (*dominium*) and Catholic doctrine on the universal spiritual worth of souls. As historian **Louis Sala-Molins** argues in *Le Code Noir, ou le calvaire de Canaan* (1987), the Code is a "theological legal monster" that uses the language of pastoral care to codify brutality. The baptism mandate (**Art. 2**) did create a discursive obligation—the enslaved had a right to sacraments and a Christian burial—that was largely absent in Protestant English colonies. However, to ask if this made French slavery "better" is to misunderstand its function. As **Sue Peabody** (*"There Are No Slaves in France"*, 1996) demonstrates, these provisions gave the system a **doctrinal veneer of legitimacy**, making it more durable by integrating it into the era’s dominant ethical framework. It was a "humanizing" gloss on a dehumanizing institution, designed more to ease the conscience of the metropole and regulate planter excesses (to protect the king’s property and social order) than to protect the enslaved.

### 3. The Enlightenment and the Code
The *Code Noir* remained in force throughout the Enlightenment, a fact that highlights the limits of philosophical universalism. **Montesquieu** offered a famously ironic critique in *De l’Esprit des Lois* (1748, Book XV, Chapter 5): "It is impossible for us to assume that these people are men, because if we assumed they were men, one would begin to believe that we ourselves are not Christians." He nonetheless defended colonial slavery as economically necessary. While **Voltaire** traded in slaves and held racist views, and **Rousseau**’s social contract was silent on colonial subjects, a principled abolitionist movement emerged late in the century. The **Société des Amis des Noirs** (founded 1788), led by **Condorcet** (*Réflexions sur l’esclavage des nègres*, 1781), **Jacques Pierre Brissot**, and supported by **Lafayette**, used Enlightenment rhetoric to demand gradual abolition. They were, however, a small minority against powerful colonial interests.

### 4. Practice and Revolt in Saint-Domingue
In **Saint-Domingue**, the Code’s theoretical protections were systematically violated in pursuit of extreme profit. The racial caste system hardened against *gens de couleur libres*, who faced increasing legal discrimination despite their freedom. The 1791 uprising, led by enslaved Africans like **Boukman Dutty**, was a direct rejection of the entire system the Code embodied. The revolutionary government in Paris, pressured by the revolt and needing colonial support, first abolished racial discrimination (1792) and then, under the radical Jacobins, **abolished slavery outright by decree on 4 February 1794 (16 Pluviôse An II)**. This was a strategic act of wartime necessity as much as principle. **Napoleon Bonaparte’s restoration of slavery in 1802** (by the law of 20 May 1802) and his failed attempt to re-conquer Saint-Domingue confirmed that the *Code Noir*’s logic of property would be violently reasserted. The success of the **Haitian Revolution (1804)** stands as the ultimate, practical refutation of the Code’s ethical framework: enslaved people asserted their personhood and freedom through force.

### 5. The Two Abolitions
France has two abolition dates, reflecting its conflicted legacy. The first, **1794**, was radical but ephemeral, reversed by Napoleon. The definitive abolition came on **27 April 1848**, under the Second Republic, driven by the relentless activism of **Victor Schoelcher**. The **Schoelcher Decree** was unequivocal: "Slavery is completely and permanently abolished throughout the colonies and French possessions." However, its ethical purity was immediately compromised by the **law of 30 April 1849**, which granted slaveholders substantial financial indemnity for their lost "property." The formerly enslaved received no compensation for their stolen labor and lives, a profound injustice that structured post-emancipation colonial economies.

### 6. Legacy and Memory
The *Code Noir*’s legacy is one of institutionalized racism and delayed reckoning. France was slower than the US or UK to memorialize slavery due to its **republican universalist ideology**, which long insisted that recognizing specific group victimhood undermined the unity of the citizenry. This began to shift with the **Taubira Law (21 May 2001)**, which recognized the slave trade and slavery as crimes against humanity and mandated school curricula on the subject. The opening of the **Mémorial ACTe in Guadeloupe (2015)**, a major museum of slavery, marked another step. Debates over **reparations**, however, remain intensely contested, often centering on the 1849 indemnity—a state payment to perpetrators—as a historical precedent that complicates contemporary claims.

### 7. Key Scholarly Interpretation
*   **Louis Sala-Molins (1987)** presents the Code as a "calvary," emphasizing its cynical use of Catholic theology to sanction atrocity.
*   **Laurent Dubois** (*Avengers of the New World*, 2004) and **Tyler Stovall** (*Paris and the Spirit of 1919*, 2012) situate the Code and its overthrow within Atlantic and imperial histories, highlighting the agency of the enslaved.
*   **Sue Peabody (1996)** meticulously details the legal tensions between the "freedom principle" in France and the colonial slave code, showing how the law itself was a site of struggle.

The *Code Noir* remains France’s most stark ethical document: a detailed blueprint for how a civilization committed to theological notions of human dignity legally engineered its systematic negation for economic gain. Its history is not one of progressive enlightenment but of violent imposition, fragile reform, catastrophic revolt, and a long, unfinished struggle with memory.

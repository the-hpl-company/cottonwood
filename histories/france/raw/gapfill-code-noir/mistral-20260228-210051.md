### **The *Code Noir* (1685): France’s Ethical Paradox of Slavery and Souls**

The *Code Noir* ("Black Code"), promulgated by Louis XIV in March 1685, stands as one of the most ethically fraught documents in French history—a legal framework that simultaneously codified the dehumanization of enslaved Africans while imposing Catholic obligations upon their masters. Its 60 articles reveal a tension between chattel slavery and Christian moral duty, a contradiction that shaped France’s colonial empire for over a century. Unlike the more purely economic slavery regimes of the English colonies, the *Code Noir* embedded slavery within a Catholic ethical framework, making it both more durable and more ethically ambiguous.

### **1. The Text Itself: Article-by-Article Ethical Analysis**

The *Code Noir* was not merely a slave code but a *colonial* code, regulating the lives of enslaved people, free people of color (*gens de couleur libres*), and white colonists in France’s Caribbean possessions (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Domingue, and later Louisiana). Its provisions reveal a system that treated enslaved people as both property and moral subjects—a duality that defined its ethical contradictions.

#### **Key Articles and Their Ethical Implications**

- **Article 2: Catholic Baptism Required**
  > *"We desire that if the slaves who shall be in our islands are not instructed and baptized within a year after their arrival, those who shall have the care of them be punished at our discretion."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** The *Code Noir* was issued under the authority of the *Conseil du Roi* but also bore the influence of the Catholic Church, particularly the *Compagnie de Jésus* (Jesuits), who sought to ensure the salvation of enslaved Africans. This provision reflected the Church’s doctrine that baptism was necessary for salvation, but it also served a political purpose: by Christianizing enslaved people, the Crown and Church could claim moral legitimacy for the system.
  - **Contradiction:** Enslaved people were baptized but remained property. The Church did not challenge slavery itself, only the *spiritual* neglect of enslaved souls. This created a paradox: enslaved people were both *meubles* (movable property, Art. 44) and *souls* requiring salvation.

- **Article 6: Sundays and Holidays Off**
  > *"We forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, to work on Sundays and holidays, even in the cultivation of their lands, under penalty of a fine."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** This provision aligned with Catholic doctrine on the Sabbath but also served a practical purpose: preventing overwork that could lead to rebellion. However, it did not apply to domestic labor, meaning enslaved women (who often worked in households) received no respite.
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* recognized enslaved people’s need for rest but not their right to refuse labor. The "day off" was not a right but a *concession*—a means of maintaining order, not dignity.

- **Article 22: Masters Must Feed and Clothe Enslaved People**
  > *"Masters shall be obliged to feed and clothe their slaves, according to the custom of the country."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** This provision reflected both Christian charity and the Roman legal principle of *patria potestas* (paternal authority), where masters had obligations toward their dependents. It also prevented starvation, which could lead to rebellion.
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* treated enslaved people as *dependents* rather than *persons*, reinforcing their status as property while imposing minimal welfare standards. Masters who failed to comply faced fines, but enforcement was weak, particularly in Saint-Domingue, where malnutrition was rampant.

- **Article 28: Enslaved People Cannot Own Property**
  > *"We declare slaves incapable of all kinds of property, and that all they may acquire shall belong to their masters."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** This article reinforced the legal fiction that enslaved people were *things*, not *persons*. It prevented them from accumulating wealth, which could lead to manumission or resistance.
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* allowed enslaved people to *cultivate* small plots (*jardins créoles*) for their own subsistence (Art. 23), but any surplus belonged to the master. This created a perverse incentive: enslaved people had to work harder to feed themselves, while masters profited from their labor.

- **Article 33: Enslaved Person Who Strikes Master May Be Executed**
  > *"The slave who shall have struck his master, his mistress, or their children, with contusion or effusion of blood, shall be punished with death."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** This provision reflected the *Code’s* primary function: maintaining white supremacy through terror. The punishment for striking a white person was death, while white violence against enslaved people was rarely prosecuted.
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* treated enslaved people as both *property* (subject to destruction if "damaged") and *moral agents* (capable of sin, hence punishable). This duality was central to its ethical incoherence.

- **Article 38: Fugitive Slave Punishments**
  > *"The fugitive slave who shall have been absent for a month shall have his ears cut off and shall be branded with a fleur-de-lis on one shoulder; if he relapses, he shall have his hamstring cut and shall be branded on the other shoulder; the third time, he shall be put to death."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** Mutilation and branding were designed to deter escape and mark enslaved people as "criminals." The *fleur-de-lis* branding linked punishment to royal authority, reinforcing the Crown’s control over colonial subjects.
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* treated flight as a *crime* rather than an act of resistance, denying enslaved people the natural right to liberty. Yet, the severity of punishment also acknowledged that enslaved people *desired* freedom—a desire the system could not suppress.

- **Article 44: Enslaved People Are Movable Property (*Meubles*)**
  > *"Slaves are movable property, and as such, they enter into the community of goods between husband and wife."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** This article was the legal cornerstone of French colonial slavery, defining enslaved people as *chattel* under the *Coutume de Paris* (customary law of Paris). It allowed masters to buy, sell, and inherit enslaved people like livestock.
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* treated enslaved people as *objects* in property law but as *moral subjects* in criminal law (e.g., punishable for theft, Art. 35). This duality was a legal fiction that served the interests of slaveholders.

- **Article 55: Manumission Provisions**
  > *"Masters aged twenty years may manumit their slaves by any act *inter vivos* or *mortis causa*, without being obliged to give any reason for their act."*
  - **Ethical Logic:** Manumission was permitted but not encouraged. The *Code* allowed masters to free enslaved people, but it also imposed restrictions: freed people (*affranchis*) had to pay a tax (Art. 56) and could be re-enslaved if they harbored fugitives (Art. 58).
  - **Contradiction:** The *Code* recognized the possibility of freedom but made it contingent on the master’s whim. This created a class of *gens de couleur libres* (free people of color), who were legally distinct from whites but still subject to racial discrimination.

### **2. The Ethical Logic: Property and Souls in Tension**

The *Code Noir*’s most striking feature is its attempt to reconcile two irreconcilable ideas:
1. **Enslaved people as *property*** (Art. 44, movable goods; Art. 28, incapable of owning property).
2. **Enslaved people as *moral subjects*** (Art. 2, baptism required; Art. 6, Sabbath rest; Art. 22, masters’ obligation to feed them).

This duality was not accidental but *structural*—a product of France’s Catholic and Roman legal traditions.

#### **The Catholic Framework: Slavery as a "Necessary Evil"**
The Church’s position on slavery was ambivalent. While Pope Paul III had condemned Indigenous enslavement in *Sublimis Deus* (1537), the Church did not extend this condemnation to African slavery. Instead, theologians like **Juan de Solórzano Pereira** (*De Indiarum Jure*, 1629) argued that slavery was a *temporal* institution, not a *spiritual* one—meaning that while enslaved people were subject to earthly bondage, their souls remained free and capable of salvation.

The *Code Noir* reflected this logic:
- **Baptism (Art. 2)** ensured that enslaved people could be saved, even if their bodies were enslaved.
- **Marriage (Art. 10-11)** was permitted (though not encouraged), reinforcing the Church’s view that enslaved people had *moral* but not *civil* personhood.
- **Restrictions on separation of families (Art. 47)** prevented masters from selling spouses or children separately, aligning with Catholic teachings on the family.

Yet, this "ethical" veneer served a darker purpose: it made slavery *more durable* by giving it a moral justification. Unlike the more purely economic slavery of the English colonies, French slavery was *sanctified* by the Church, making it harder to challenge on ethical grounds.

#### **Was the *Code Noir* "Better" Than English Slavery?**
Some historians (e.g., **Sue Peabody**) argue that the *Code Noir*’s protections (e.g., Sabbath rest, minimal welfare standards) made French slavery "less brutal" than English or Dutch systems. However, this view is contested:
- **Louis Sala-Molins** (*Le Code Noir, ou le calvaire de Canaan*, 1987) argues that the *Code* was *more* insidious because it *legitimized* slavery through Catholic ethics, making it harder to abolish.
- **Laurent Dubois** (*Avengers of the New World*, 2004) notes that the *Code*’s "protections" were rarely enforced, particularly in Saint-Domingue, where masters routinely flouted its provisions.

**Conclusion:** The *Code Noir* was not "better"—it was *different*. By embedding slavery within a Catholic moral framework, it made the system *more resilient* to abolitionist critique, even as it imposed minimal obligations on masters.

### **3. The *Code Noir* and the Enlightenment: Philosophes, Irony, and Abolitionism**

The *Code Noir* remained in force throughout the Enlightenment, exposing a profound tension between France’s intellectual ideals and its colonial practices.

#### **Montesquieu’s Ironic Critique (*The Spirit of the Laws*, 1748, XV.5)**
Montesquieu, the great theorist of law and liberty, famously mocked the *Code Noir* in *De l’esprit des lois*:
> *"It is impossible for us to suppose that these people are men, because if we supposed them to be men, one would begin to believe that we ourselves were not Christians."*
- **Irony:** Montesquieu did not condemn slavery outright but used *satire* to expose its absurdity. He argued that slavery was a *despotic* institution, incompatible with moderate government.
- **Limitation:** Montesquieu’s critique was *theoretical*, not abolitionist. He did not call for emancipation but for the *reform* of slavery—a position that reflected the ambivalence of many Enlightenment thinkers.

#### **The Philosophes’ Divided Positions**
The Enlightenment was not uniformly abolitionist. Key figures held varying views:
- **Voltaire:** Initially defended slavery in *Candide* (1759) as a "necessary evil" for colonial economies but later criticized it in *Essai sur les mœurs* (1756).
- **Diderot:** Condemned slavery in the *Encyclopédie* (1751-1772) but did not advocate immediate abolition.
- **Condorcet:** One of the few to demand *immediate* abolition in *Réflexions sur l’esclavage des nègres* (1781), arguing that slavery was a violation of natural rights.

#### **The *Société des Amis des Noirs* (1788)**
Founded by **Jacques-Pierre Brissot**, **Condorcet**, and **Lafayette**, this abolitionist society sought gradual emancipation. Its members included:
- **Olympe de Gouges** (*Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne*, 1791), who linked abolition to women’s rights.
- **Abbé Grégoire**, who argued that slavery was incompatible with Christianity.

**Limitation:** The *Société* was small and elite-driven. It faced opposition from colonial planters, who wielded significant political power.

### **4. Saint-Domingue: The *Code Noir* in Practice and Its Collapse**

The *Code Noir* was most brutally tested in **Saint-Domingue** (modern Haiti), France’s richest colony, where enslaved Africans outnumbered whites by 10:1 by 1789.

#### **The Racial Caste System**
The *Code Noir* created a rigid hierarchy:
1. **Whites** (*blancs*) – Full legal rights.
2. **Free People of Color** (*gens de couleur libres*) – Often mixed-race, wealthy, but legally discriminated against (e.g., banned from certain professions, required to defer to whites).
3. **Enslaved Africans** – No rights, subject to the *Code Noir*’s brutal punishments.

**Tension:** The *gens de couleur* were a growing class of wealthy landowners (some owned slaves themselves). Their legal exclusion from political rights fueled resentment, leading to the **1790 Ogé Rebellion**, a precursor to the Haitian Revolution.

#### **The 1791 Uprising and the Death of the *Code Noir***
The **August 1791 slave revolt**, led by **Boukman Dutty** and later **Toussaint Louverture**, shattered the *Code Noir*’s legal fiction. The rebels rejected both slavery and French rule, demanding *liberty or death*.

- **1793:** The **Commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel** abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue to secure rebel support against British and Spanish forces.
- **1794:** The **National Convention** (under Robespierre) abolished slavery *throughout the French colonies* (Decree of 4 February 1794), declaring:
  > *"Slavery is abolished in all the colonies; consequently, all men, without distinction of color, residing in the colonies, are French citizens and enjoy all the rights assured by the Constitution."*

**Irony:** The *Code Noir*, which had sought to regulate slavery, was undone by the very people it sought to control. The Haitian Revolution (1804) was the ultimate ethical refutation of its logic.

#### **Napoleon’s Betrayal (1802)**
Napoleon, seeking to restore France’s colonial empire, **reinstated slavery** in 1802 (Law of 20 May 1802). This led to:
- **Toussaint Louverture’s arrest** (1802) and death in a French prison (1803).
- **The final Haitian Revolution** (1804), where **Jean-Jacques Dessalines** declared independence, creating the first Black republic.

**Legacy:** The *Code Noir*’s failure in Saint-Domingue exposed its ethical bankruptcy. Slavery could not be "regulated"—it had to be destroyed.

### **5. The Two Abolitions: 1794 and 1848**

France abolished slavery *twice*—first in a moment of revolutionary idealism, then in a moment of democratic principle.

#### **First Abolition (1794): The Convention’s Decree**
- **Context:** The **National Convention** (1792-1795) abolished slavery as a *wartime necessity*, not a moral imperative. The decree was driven by:
  - The need to secure Saint-Domingue against British invasion.
  - The influence of **Abbé Grégoire** and the *Société des Amis des Noirs*.
- **Limitation:** The 1794 abolition was *incomplete*—it did not apply to all colonies (e.g., Réunion, Mauritius) and was poorly enforced.

#### **Restoration of Slavery (1802)**
Napoleon’s **Law of 20 May 1802** reinstated slavery, citing:
- Economic necessity (colonial sugar production).
- Racial hierarchy (Napoleon feared racial equality would undermine white supremacy).

#### **Second Abolition (1848): The Schoelcher Decree**
- **Context:** The **Second Republic** (1848-1852) abolished slavery under the leadership of **Victor Schoelcher**, a journalist and abolitionist.
- **The Decree of 27 April 1848** declared:
  > *"Slavery is entirely abolished in all the colonies and possessions of France."*
- **Key Provisions:**
  - **Immediate emancipation** (no apprenticeship system, unlike British abolition in 1833).
  - **Compensation for slaveholders** (not for the formerly enslaved).
  - **Citizenship for freed people** (though racial discrimination persisted).

**Ethical Failure:** The 1848 abolition was *principled* but *incomplete*. The French state paid **126 million francs** (≈$5 billion today) in compensation to slaveholders, while formerly enslaved people received nothing. This set a precedent for later reparations debates.

### **6. The *Code Noir*’s Legacy: Memory, Reparations, and Justice**

The *Code Noir* was officially repealed in 1848, but its legacy persists in France’s colonial memory.

#### **The Taubira Law (2001)**
- **Law No. 2001-434 (21 May 2001)**, sponsored by **Christiane Taubira**, recognized slavery as a **crime against humanity**.
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Mandated the teaching of slavery in schools.
  - Established

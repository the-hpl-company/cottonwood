### **The Franco-Jewish Ethical Tradition: A Distinct Thread in French Intellectual History**

The Franco-Jewish ethical tradition is a complex, often contradictory lineage that has evolved in dialogue—and conflict—with France’s broader intellectual, political, and religious currents. From medieval rabbinical scholarship to contemporary debates over antisemitism and republicanism, this tradition has shaped and been shaped by France’s ethical frameworks, sometimes reinforcing and sometimes challenging dominant norms. Below, we trace its development through key historical moments, internal tensions, and ethical dilemmas.

---

### **1. Medieval Jewry: Rashi, the Tosafists, and a Parallel Ethical Tradition (11th–13th Centuries)**

The foundations of the Franco-Jewish ethical tradition were laid in medieval Champagne and northern France, where Jewish scholars developed a distinct exegetical and legal tradition alongside—and often in tension with—Christian scholasticism.

#### **Rashi (Shlomo Yitzhaki, 1040–1105) of Troyes**
Rashi’s commentaries on the **Talmud** and **Tanakh** (Hebrew Bible) became the most influential in Jewish history, shaping both Ashkenazi and Sephardic thought. His method emphasized:
- **Peshat (plain sense interpretation)**: A rejection of midrashic allegory in favor of grammatical and contextual clarity.
- **Concision and accessibility**: Unlike the dense dialectics of Christian scholastics (e.g., Thomas Aquinas’s *Summa Theologica*, 1265–1274), Rashi’s work was pragmatic, aimed at legal application and communal instruction.
- **Integration of French vernacular**: Rashi occasionally used Old French (*laaz*) to explain Hebrew terms, embedding Jewish learning in the linguistic and cultural milieu of medieval France.

His **commentary on the Talmud** (completed posthumously by his students) became a cornerstone of Jewish education, while his **Bible commentary** (e.g., on *Genesis*, 1080s) influenced Christian Hebraists like Nicholas of Lyra (1270–1349), whose *Postillae* (1322–1331) drew on Rashi’s work.

#### **The Tosafists (12th–13th Centuries)**
Rashi’s descendants and students—particularly his grandsons **Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir, c. 1085–1158)** and **Rabbeinu Tam (Jacob ben Meir, 1100–1171)**—developed the **Tosafot** ("additions"), a layer of Talmudic commentary that:
- **Engaged in dialectical reasoning** (e.g., reconciling contradictory Talmudic passages), paralleling Christian scholastic methods but remaining rooted in halakhic (Jewish legal) concerns.
- **Debated Christian polemics**: The **Disputation of Paris (1240)**, where Rabbi **Yehiel of Paris** defended the Talmud against Nicholas Donin’s accusations, forced Jewish scholars to refine their arguments in response to Christian theological challenges.
- **Navigated communal autonomy**: The **Takkanot Shum** (ordinances of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz, 12th–13th centuries) regulated Jewish self-governance, balancing internal cohesion with external pressures from Christian authorities.

**Ethical Tension**: Unlike Christian scholasticism, which sought to harmonize faith and reason under Church authority, the Franco-Jewish tradition prioritized **communal survival and legal autonomy**. The Tosafists’ work was not abstract theology but a **living ethical framework** for a minority navigating persecution (e.g., the **First Crusade massacres, 1096**) and economic restrictions (e.g., **Church bans on moneylending to Christians**).

### **2. Expulsions and Returns: The Fragmentation of French Jewry (14th–18th Centuries)**

The medieval Franco-Jewish tradition was violently disrupted by expulsions, forcing Jews into exile or clandestine existence, while later readmissions created divergent Sephardic and Ashkenazi communities.

#### **The Expulsion of 1306 (Philip IV)**
King **Philip IV ("the Fair")** expelled France’s Jews in **1306**, seizing their property and canceling debts owed to them. The expulsion was motivated by:
- **Financial exploitation**: Jews were accused of usury (despite Church prohibitions on Christian lending), and their expulsion allowed the crown to confiscate assets.
- **Theological hostility**: The **1215 Fourth Lateran Council** had mandated Jewish badges and restricted Jewish-Christian interaction, fostering an environment of persecution.

#### **Readmission and the Converso Diaspora**
- **1315 Readmission (Louis X)**: Jews were briefly readmitted under restrictive conditions (e.g., wearing badges, paying special taxes).
- **1394 Final Expulsion (Charles VI)**: Jews were expelled again, this time permanently from royal France (though some remained in papal Avignon and Alsace).
- **Portuguese Conversos in Bayonne and Bordeaux (16th–18th centuries)**: After the **1492 Spanish Expulsion** and **1497 Portuguese forced conversions**, Sephardic Jews (many secretly practicing Judaism) settled in southwestern France. By the 18th century, they formed a distinct **Portuguese Nation** (*Nation Portugaise*), granted privileges by Louis XV in **1723** and **1776**.

**Ethical Tension**:
- **Sephardic vs. Ashkenazi Identity**: The Sephardic community, with its Iberian heritage, was more integrated into French commercial and intellectual life (e.g., **Isaac de Pinto’s *Apologie pour la nation juive*, 1762**, defending Jews to Voltaire). Ashkenazi Jews, arriving later from Eastern Europe, faced greater suspicion.
- **Marranism (Crypto-Judaism)**: The converso experience created a **dual ethical framework**—public conformity to Christianity, private adherence to Judaism—raising questions about **authenticity and survival**.

### **3. Emancipation (1791): The Birth of the "Israelite" Citizen**

The French Revolution’s emancipation of Jews in **1791** was the first in Europe, but it came with a **radical ethical condition**: the surrender of communal autonomy in exchange for individual citizenship.

#### **The Clermont-Tonnerre Formulation (December 23, 1789)**
Count **Stanislas de Clermont-Tonnerre** declared to the National Assembly:
> *"To the Jews as a nation, nothing; to the Jews as individuals, everything."*

This principle was codified in the **September 27, 1791 decree**, which granted Jews full citizenship **on the condition that they dissolve their corporate structures** (e.g., rabbinical courts, communal taxes).

#### **Napoleon’s Sanhedrin (1807)**
Napoleon convened an **Assembly of Jewish Notables (1806)** and a **Grand Sanhedrin (1807)** to ensure Jewish loyalty to the state. The Sanhedrin’s decisions:
- **Affirmed Jewish allegiance to French law** (e.g., permitting intermarriage, military service).
- **Rejected dual loyalty**: Jews were to be **French first, Jewish second**, a model later termed **"Israelite" identity**.

**Ethical Tension**:
- **Assimilation vs. Tradition**: Emancipation demanded **cultural erasure** in exchange for rights. Rabbi **David Sintzheim** (first chief rabbi of France) and others sought to reconcile halakha with republicanism, but many feared **loss of Jewish distinctiveness**.
- **The "Regeneration" Debate**: The **Consistoire Israélite (1808)**, a state-controlled Jewish body, enforced reforms (e.g., French-language sermons, secular education), leading to resistance from traditionalists.

### **4. The Dreyfus Affair: Jewish Ethical Responses to Antisemitism**

The **Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906)** exposed the fragility of Jewish emancipation and provoked **divergent ethical responses** within the Jewish community.

#### **Theodor Herzl and the Birth of Political Zionism**
- **Herzl’s *The Jewish State* (1896)**: Witnessing Captain **Alfred Dreyfus’s degradation ceremony (1895)**, Herzl concluded that **emancipation had failed** and that Jews needed a **sovereign state**. His pamphlet argued:
  > *"The Jewish question persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers. Where it does not exist, it is brought in together with Jewish immigrants."*
- **First Zionist Congress (1897)**: Herzl’s vision was a **direct ethical response to French antisemitism**, rejecting the **assimilationist model** of the Israelite tradition.

#### **Bernard Lazare’s Radical Critique**
- **Lazare’s *Antisemitism, Its History and Causes* (1894)**: A **left-wing anarchist and Dreyfusard**, Lazare argued that antisemitism was **structural**, rooted in Christian theology and capitalist exploitation. Unlike Herzl, he **rejected Zionism**, advocating instead for **revolutionary universalism**:
  > *"The Jew is the eternal protester, the man who says no to the established order."*
- **Lazare’s Break with Herzl**: He later condemned Zionism as a **bourgeois nationalist project**, aligning with **socialist internationalism**.

#### **Jewish Communal Divisions**
- **Assimilationists (e.g., Chief Rabbi **Zadoc Kahn**)**: Defended Dreyfus while **reaffirming loyalty to France**.
- **Nationalists (e.g., **Edouard Drumont’s *La France Juive*, 1886**)**: Used Dreyfus to argue that Jews were **inherently disloyal**.
- **Socialists (e.g., **Jean Jaurès**)**: Saw Dreyfus as a **class issue**, not a Jewish one.

**Ethical Tension**:
- **Universalism vs. Particularism**: The affair forced French Jews to choose between **republican assimilation** and **Jewish self-assertion**. Herzl’s Zionism and Lazare’s anarchism represented **opposing ethical paths**.

### **5. The Shoah in France: Collaboration, Resistance, and Ethical Reckoning**

The **Vichy regime (1940–1944)** and the **Nazi occupation** subjected French Jews to **state-sponsored persecution**, revealing the **limits of republican universalism**.

#### **Vichy’s Statut des Juifs (October 3, 1940)**
- **Drafted by French officials** (not German occupiers), the **Statut des Juifs** defined Jews **racially** (not religiously) and excluded them from professions (e.g., teaching, journalism).
- **Second Statut (June 2, 1941)**: Expanded exclusions and mandated a **census of Jews**.
- **Aryanization of Jewish property**: The **Commissariat-General for Jewish Questions (CGQJ)**, led by **Xavier Vallat**, oversaw the **seizure of Jewish assets**.

#### **The Vel d’Hiv Roundup (July 16–17, 1942)**
- **French police** (not Germans) arrested **13,152 Jews** (including **4,115 children**) in Paris, holding them at the **Vélodrome d’Hiver** before deportation to **Auschwitz**.
- **Total deported from France**: **76,000 Jews** (including **11,000 children**); only **2,500 returned**.

#### **Resistance and Rescue**
- **Le Chambon-sur-Lignon**: The Protestant village, led by **Pastor André Trocmé** and **Magda Trocmé**, saved **3,000–5,000 Jews** (mostly children). Trocmé’s **ethic of "active nonviolence"** was rooted in **Huguenot resistance to persecution**.
- **Hidden Children**: **Catholic convents, Protestant families, and secular networks** hid Jewish children (e.g., **Serge Klarsfeld’s *Le Mémorial de la Déportation des Juifs de France*, 1978**, documents 8,000 hidden children).

**Ethical Tension**:
- **State Collaboration vs. Individual Resistance**: Vichy’s **legal antisemitism** (e.g., **Marschal Pétain’s speeches**) contrasted with **individual acts of defiance**, raising questions about **collective guilt and moral responsibility**.
- **Postwar Silence**: The myth of **"resistancialisme"** (France as a nation of resisters) obscured Vichy’s role until **Marcel Ophüls’s *The Sorrow and the Pity* (1969)** and **Robert Paxton’s *Vichy France* (1972)** forced a reckoning.

### **6. Postwar Jewish Philosophy: Ethics After the Catastrophe**

The Shoah shattered the **Israelite ideal** of seamless integration, leading to a **reconfiguration of Franco-Jewish ethics** in philosophy, theology, and memory.

#### **Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics as First Philosophy**
Levinas, a **Lithuanian-born Jew educated in France**, developed a **phenomenology of the Other** rooted in **Talmudic ethics** and **post-Holocaust thought**.
- **Totality and Infinity (1961)**: Argues that **Western philosophy** (from Plato to Heidegger) reduces the Other to the Same, enabling **totalitarian violence**. The **face of the Other** demands **infinite responsibility**:
  > *"The face is what forbids us to kill."*
- **Otherwise than Being (1974)**: Introduces the concept of **"substitution"**—the self as **hostage to the Other**, a radical ethical demand.
- **Talmudic Readings**: Levinas’s **annual Talmudic lectures at the Colloque des intellectuels juifs** (1957–1989) reinterpreted rabbinic texts through **existential and ethical lenses**, bridging **Jewish tradition and French philosophy**.

**Ethical Tension**:
- **Universalism vs. Particularism**: Levinas’s ethics are **universal** (the Other could be anyone) but **rooted in Jewish particularity**. Critics (e.g., **Jacques Derrida**) questioned whether his ethics could **transcend its Jewish origins**.

#### **André Neher: The Exile of the Word**
- **The Exile of the Word (1970)**: Neher, a **French-Algerian rabbi and philosopher**, argued that **Jewish ethics** emerge from **exile**—a condition of **absence and waiting**. The **Shoah** was not a rupture but a **manifestation of eternal Jewish exile**.
- **Silence and Revelation**: Neher’s work explores **the ethical weight of silence** (e.g., **Job’s refusal to curse God**) as a **response to suffering**.

#### **Vladimir Jankélévitch: The Imprescriptibility of Evil**
- **"Should We Pardon Them?" (1971)**: Jankélévitch, a **French-Jewish philosopher**, argued that **crimes against humanity** (e.g., the Shoah) are **imprescriptible**—they **cannot be forgiven or forgotten**. His essay was a **direct challenge to postwar reconciliation**:
  > *"Forgiveness died in the death camps."*
- **Influence on Law**: His work shaped France’s **1964 law** declaring crimes against humanity **imprescriptible**.

#### **Jacques Derrida: The Algerian Jew and Colonial Ethics**
Derrida, born in **Algeria to a Sephardic family**, explored the **colonial dimensions of French Jewish identity**.
- **Monolingualism of the Other (1996)**: Reflects on **linguistic alienation**—French as both a **language of emancipation** and **colonial domination**.
- **Circumfession (1991)**: A **postmodern midrash** blending **autobiography, theology, and deconstruction**, grappling with **Jewish identity in a secular world**.

**Ethical Tension**:
- **Memory vs. Justice**: Postwar Jewish thinkers debated whether **memory** (e.g., **Holocaust commemoration**) could coexist with **justice** (e.g., **trials of collaborators**).

### **7. Contemporary Debates: The "New Antisemitism" and Jewish Emigration**

Since the **2000s**, France has faced a **resurgence of antisemitism**, prompting **Jewish emigration** and **renewed ethical dilemmas** about **republicanism, Zionism, and communal survival**.

#### **Key Events**
- **Ilan Halimi’s Murder (2006)**: A **23-year-old Jewish man** was tortured and killed by the **"Gang of Barbarians"**, a group motivated by **antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish wealth**.
- **Toulouse Shootings (2012)**: **Mohamed Merah** killed **three Jewish children and a teacher** at a **Jewish school**, shocking France and exposing **Islamist antisemitism**.
- **Hyper Cacher Attack (2015)**: **Amedy Coulibaly** killed **four Jews** in a **kosher supermarket**, days after the **Charlie Hebdo massacre**.

#### **Jewish Emigration to Israel**
- **2015 Peak**: **8,000 French Jews** made *aliyah* (emigration to Israel), the **highest number since 1948**.
- **2023**: **~2,000 emigrated**, reflecting **ongoing security concerns**.

#### **Intellectual Responses**
- **Alain Finkielkraut’s Evolution**:
  - **The Imaginary Jew (1980)**: Critiqued **Jewish self-hatred** and **assimilationist illusions**.
  - **The Unhappy Identity (2013)**: Warned of **Islamist antisemitism** and **left-wing denial**, alienating former allies.
- **Esther Benbassa’s Universalism**:
  - **The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present (2001)**: Argues for **Jewish integration** while critiquing **Zionist separatism**.
  - **Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction (2020)**: Distinguishes between **criticism of Israel** and **antisemitism**, clashing with **Finkielkraut and the CRIF (Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France)**.

**Ethical Tension**:
- **Republican Universalism vs. Communal Survival**: The **2004 ban on religious symbols

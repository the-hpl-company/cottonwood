## Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592): The Invention of the Essay as Ethical Method

### 1. The *Essais* as Ethical Revolution: "Que sais-je?" and the Anti-Dogmatic Form
Montaigne’s *Essais*—first published in 1580 (Books I & II), expanded in 1588 (Book III), and posthumously in 1595 with his manuscript additions—constitute a deliberate rupture with prior ethical writing. Unlike **scholastic treatises** (e.g., Aquinas’s *Summa Theologica*, 1265–1274), which proceed via syllogism and authority, or **humanist moral philosophy** (e.g., Erasmus’s *Enchiridion*, 1503), which offers prescriptive advice, Montaigne’s essay is **provisional, self-correcting, and rooted in confessed ignorance**. His famous motto, **"Que sais-je?"** ("What do I know?"), engraved on his library ceiling and appearing throughout the *Essais* (notably in "Apology for Raymond Sebond," II.12), is not skepticism for its own sake but an **ethical starting point**: humility before dogma. As he writes in "Of the Art of Discussion" (III.8), "I propose a life without a fixed plan... each day furnishes its own instructions." The essay’s form—digressive, contradictory, anchored in the particular—enacts an ethics of **intellectual honesty and fallibility**.

### 2. "Of Cannibals" (I.31): The Foreign as Ethical Mirror
In this 1580 essay, Montaigne uses reports of the Brazilian Tupinamba to stage a radical critique of European moral superiority. His key ethical insight: **"Each man calls barbarism whatever is not his own practice"** (I.31). He argues that Tupinamba ritual cannibalism (eating the dead to absorb courage) is **less barbarous** than contemporary European practices: "I think there is more barbarity in eating a man alive than in eating him dead; and in tearing by tortures and the rack a body still full of feeling... under the pretext of piety and religion" (I.31). This is not naïve primitivism but a **method**: using the foreign to **defamiliarize and examine domestic cruelty**, particularly the atrocities of the French Wars of Religion. His source is a direct interview with a Tupinamba man brought to Rouen in 1562, grounding his critique in witnessed testimony.

### 3. "Of Coaches" (III.6): Condemnation of Colonial Conquest
The companion piece to "Of Cannibals," this 1588 essay moves from cultural critique to explicit political indictment of Spanish conquest in the Americas. Montaigne condemns the **destruction of advanced civilizations** (the Inca, Aztec) "for the traffic in pearls and pepper" (III.6). His ethical framework centers on **recognition of indigenous dignity and achievement**: "So many cities razed, so many nations exterminated... for the purpose of commerce and traffic!" He contrasts European technological superiority ("coaches" as symbols of oppressive power) with indigenous political and architectural sophistication, arguing that conquest is motivated by **greed, not civilizing mission**. This constitutes one of the earliest ethical arguments against colonialism from within Europe.

### 4. "Of Experience" (III.13): The Body as Ethical Teacher
Montaigne’s final essay (1588) is his most sustained ethical statement, centering on **embodied, lived experience** as the ground of wisdom. "I study myself more than any other subject. That is my metaphysics; that is my physics" (III.13). Rejecting abstract systems, he details his aging body, his dietary habits, his kidney stones—arguing that **attention to particularity and limitation** is the path to a humane ethics. "Life is a material and corporal movement... I accept with all my heart what pleasure brings me" (III.13). This **ethics of immanence** prioritizes moderation, self-knowledge, and acceptance of finitude over transcendental ideals.

### 5. "Of Cruelty" (II.11): The Primacy of Compassion
Here Montaigne identifies **cruelty as "the extreme of all vices"** (II.11). He argues against judicial torture (routine in 16th-century France) and expresses **vegetarian sympathies** based on concern for animal suffering: "I cannot without distress see an innocent and defenseless animal pursued and killed" (II.11). While not fully consistent (he admits to eating meat), his ethical sensitivity to non-human pain is remarkably early in European thought. He grounds his aversion in **innate repugnance** rather than doctrine: "Nature herself, I fear, attaches to man some instinct for inhumanity."

### 6. The Wars of Religion as Ethical Crucible
Montaigne served as Mayor of Bordeaux (1581–1585) during the height of religious violence between Catholics and Protestants. The *Essais* are a direct response to this **ethical catastrophe**. His friendship with **Étienne de La Boétie** (1530–1563) and his decision to publish La Boétie’s *Discourse on Voluntary Servitude* (1576) in a volume of *Mémoires* (not in the *Essais* themselves) reveal his political ethics: a critique of tyranny tempered by fear of fueling further violence. Montaigne’s own position was **politique**—prioritizing civil peace over religious purity—and his essays advocate tolerance, moderation, and suspicion of ideological fervor.

### 7. Legacy: The Essayistic Tradition as French Ethical Contribution
Montaigne’s form inaugurated a **distinctive French ethical tradition** rooted in **personal reflection, psychological nuance, and anti-systematic inquiry**.
- **Blaise Pascal** (1623–1662), while critiquing Montaigne’s skepticism in *Pensées* (1670), adopted his introspective method.
- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (1712–1778) extended Montaigne’s focus on the self in *Confessions* (1782).
- **Friedrich Nietzsche** (1844–1900) admired Montaigne as "the freest and mightiest of souls" (*Schopenhauer as Educator*, 1874).
- **Existentialism** (e.g., Albert Camus) inherits Montaigne’s emphasis on **lived experience, absurdity, and ethical creation in a godless world**.

This tradition stands apart from **German systematic philosophy** (Kant, Hegel) and **British empiricism** (Locke, Hume) in its literary, subjective, and essayistic character.

### 8. Key Scholarly Interpretations
- **Hugo Friedrich**, *Montaigne* (1949, French trans. 1968): Emphasizes Montaigne’s skepticism and crisis of the self.
- **Jean Starobinski**, *Montaigne in Motion* (1982): Analyzes the dynamic, self-revising nature of the essay form.
- **Philippe Desan**, *Montaigne: A Life* (2014, English trans. 2017): Contextualizes Montaigne as a political actor and networker.
- **Ann Hartle**, *Michel de Montaigne: Accidental Philosopher* (2003): Argues for Montaigne’s coherent but unsystematic philosophy rooted in conversation.

Montaigne’s ethical legacy lies not in doctrines but in a **method of inquiry**: humble, embodied, comparative, and relentlessly focused on the human condition in all its particularity. His essays remain France’s foundational contribution to an ethics of **modesty, compassion, and intellectual honesty**.

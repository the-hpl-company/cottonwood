### Michel de Montaigne and the Foundations of French Ethical Thought  
  
Montaigne (1533-1592), born into the French aristocracy during the Wars of Religion, revolutionized ethical thought with his *Essais* (1580, 1588, 1595 posthumous). His work marks a decisive break from medieval scholasticism and Renaissance humanism, introducing a profoundly personal, provisional, and anti-dogmatic approach to ethics. Montaigne's skeptical inquiry—embodied in his motto "Que sais-je?" (What do I know?)—became a template for questioning inherited moral certainties and examining the complexities of lived experience.  

#### 1. The *Essais*: Ethical Method and Anti-Dogmatism  
Montaigne's *Essais* inaugurated the essay as a literary and ethical form. Unlike scholastic treatises, which sought systematic certainty, or humanist rhetoric, which often aimed at persuasion, Montaigne's essays are marked by their provisional, self-correcting nature. He writes in "Of Repentance" (III.2): "I do not portray being: I portray passing... My history needs to be adapted to the moment." This emphasis on flux and uncertainty reflects Montaigne's ethical method: rather than prescribing fixed norms, he explores moral questions through introspection and dialogue with the self.  

#### 2. "Of Cannibals" (I.31): Ethical Critique of Colonialism  
In "Of Cannibals," Montaigne offers one of the first sustained critiques of European colonialism from within European thought. He contrasts the ritual cannibalism of the Brazilian Tupinamba with the atrocities of European religious warfare, stating, "I think there is more barbarity in…tearing by tortures and the rack a body still full of feeling…than in roasting and eating him after he is dead." Montaigne's ethical methodology here is striking: he uses the "foreign" to interrogate the "domestic," exposing the hypocrisy of European moral superiority. His observation, "Each man calls barbarism whatever is not his own practice," remains a powerful critique of cultural chauvinism.  

#### 3. "Of Coaches" (III.6): Condemnation of Conquest  
In "Of Coaches," Montaigne expands his critique of colonialism, focusing explicitly on the Spanish conquest of the Americas. He laments the destruction of indigenous civilizations, writing, "So many cities razed to the ground, so many nations exterminated…for the traffic in pearls and pepper!" Here, Montaigne's ethical framework centers on the dignity of all cultures and the moral bankruptcy of conquest. His condemnation of colonial violence anticipates later Enlightenment critiques.  

#### 4. "Of Experience" (III.13): The Ethics of Limitation  
Montaigne's final essay, "Of Experience," is perhaps his most profound ethical statement. He writes, "I study myself more than any other subject. That is my metaphysics; that is my physics." By grounding ethics in the lived experience of the body—aging, suffering, pleasure—Montaigne rejects abstract moral systems in favor of concrete, embodied wisdom. This focus on limitation and finitude anticipates existentialism's emphasis on human contingency.  

#### 5. "Of Cruelty" (II.11): The Worst Vice  
In "Of Cruelty," Montaigne identifies cruelty as humanity's greatest moral failing. He condemns torture, writing, "Even in the case of justice, if I were to be punished, I should prefer to be punished severely rather than cruelly." His vegetarian sympathies and concern for animal suffering are remarkably early: "There is a certain respect…that attaches us to the general condition of nature." Montaigne's empathy for non-human life foreshadows later ethical developments in animal rights.  

#### 6. Montaigne and the Wars of Religion  
Montaigne served as mayor of Bordeaux (1581-1585) during the Wars of Religion, a period marked by brutal sectarian violence. His essays can be read as a response to this ethical catastrophe. His friendship with Étienne de La Boétie, author of the *Discourse on Voluntary Servitude* (1576), deeply influenced his thought. Montaigne's skepticism, moderation, and commitment to dialogue reflect his attempt to navigate an era of religious extremism.  

#### 7. Legacy: From Pascal to Nietzsche  
Montaigne's influence extends across centuries. Blaise Pascal, who criticized Montaigne's skepticism, nevertheless adopted his introspective method. Jean-Jacques Rousseau drew on Montaigne's emphasis on authenticity and experience, while Friedrich Nietzsche admired his rejection of moral dogmatism. The essayistic tradition Montaigne inaugurated remains France's distinctive ethical contribution, prioritising lived experience over systematic abstraction.  

#### 8. Key Scholars  
Critical interpretations of Montaigne's ethics include Hugo Friedrich's *Montaigne* (1949), which analyses his skeptical method; Jean Starobinski's *Montaigne in Motion* (1982), which explores the dynamic, self-reflexive nature of his essays; Philippe Desan's *Montaigne: A Life* (2014), which situates his thought in its historical context; and Ann Hartle's *Michel de Montaigne: Accidental Philosopher* (2003), which examines his ethical originality.  

Montaigne's *Essais* remain a touchstone for ethical inquiry, challenging readers to confront their own uncertainties and prejudices. His blend of skepticism, humility, and empathy offers a model for ethical thought grounded in the complexities of human experience.

### **Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592): The Invention of the Ethical Essay and the Foundations of French Moral Thought**

Michel de Montaigne’s *Essais* (1580, expanded 1588, posthumous 1595) mark a radical departure from both medieval scholasticism and Renaissance humanism, establishing the personal essay as a new ethical method. Unlike the systematic treatises of Aquinas or the rhetorical moralizing of Erasmus, Montaigne’s work is provisional, self-interrogating, and deeply skeptical of dogma. His famous question—**"Que sais-je?" (What do I know?)**—is not a rhetorical flourish but an ethical starting point: the admission of ignorance as the only honest foundation for moral inquiry. This anti-dogmatic stance distinguishes him from both the certainties of scholasticism (e.g., Aquinas’s *Summa Theologica*, 1265–1274) and the classical revivalism of humanist ethics (e.g., Erasmus’s *De civilitate morum puerilium*, 1530).

#### **1. The *Essais* as Ethical Method: The Essay as Anti-Dogmatic Form**
Montaigne’s innovation lies in his rejection of fixed moral systems in favor of a **self-correcting, experiential ethics**. Unlike scholasticism, which sought universal principles through syllogistic reasoning, or humanism, which often moralized through classical exempla, Montaigne’s essays are **fragmentary, digressive, and deeply personal**. He writes in *Of Experience* (III.13):
> *"I study myself more than any other subject. That is my metaphysics; that is my physics."* (III.13)

This turn inward—what Hugo Friedrich (*Montaigne*, 1949) calls *"the discovery of the self"*—is not narcissistic but **ethically generative**. By examining his own bodily habits, fears, and contradictions, Montaigne models a **morality of attention** rather than prescription. The essay form itself—*"essai"* meaning "attempt"—embodies this provisional approach. As Jean Starobinski (*Montaigne in Motion*, 1982) argues, Montaigne’s writing is **kinetic**, constantly revising itself, resisting closure.

This method contrasts sharply with:
- **Scholastic ethics** (e.g., Aquinas’s *Summa*), which sought deductive certainty.
- **Humanist ethics** (e.g., Erasmus’s *Enchiridion militis Christiani*, 1503), which often moralized through classical exempla.
- **Stoic and Epicurean manuals** (e.g., Seneca’s *Letters*), which offered prescriptive rules.

Montaigne’s ethics, by contrast, is **anti-systematic, anti-authoritarian, and deeply suspicious of abstraction**.

#### **2. "Of Cannibals" (I.31): The Foreign as Ethical Mirror**
Montaigne’s most famous essay, *"Of Cannibals"* (I.31), is arguably the first sustained **ethical critique of European colonialism from within European thought**. Drawing on accounts of Brazilian Tupinamba tribes (likely from André Thevet’s *Les Singularitez de la France Antarctique*, 1557), Montaigne inverts the colonial gaze:
> *"Each man calls barbarism whatever is not his own practice; as, indeed, we have no other test of truth and reason than the example and pattern of the opinions and customs of the country we live in."* (I.31)

This passage is **ethically revolutionary** for three reasons:
1. **Relativism as critique**: Montaigne does not argue that Tupinamba practices are *superior* but that they are **no more barbaric than European religious warfare** (e.g., the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, 1572).
2. **The foreign as ethical corrective**: By holding up the "savage" as a mirror, Montaigne forces Europeans to confront their own cruelty.
3. **Rejection of civilizational hierarchy**: Unlike later Enlightenment thinkers (e.g., Diderot’s *Supplement au Voyage de Bougainville*, 1772), Montaigne does not romanticize the "noble savage" but **grants the Tupinamba their own dignity**.

Philippe Desan (*Montaigne: A Life*, 2017) notes that this essay is **not anthropological but ethical**: Montaigne is less interested in the Tupinamba themselves than in **what their existence reveals about European hypocrisy**.

#### **3. "Of Coaches" (III.6): The Ethics of Conquest**
Where *"Of Cannibals"* is subtle, *"Of Coaches"* (III.6) is **explicitly political**, condemning Spanish conquest in the Americas. Montaigne writes:
> *"So many cities razed, so many nations exterminated, so many millions of people put to the sword, and the richest and most beautiful part of the world turned upside down for the traffic in pearls and pepper! Mechanic victories!"* (III.6)

This passage is remarkable for its **early anti-colonialism**, predating Las Casas’s *A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies* (1552) in its **moral outrage**. Montaigne’s argument is not economic or strategic but **ethical**:
- **Conquest destroys civilizations** that had their own achievements (e.g., Aztec and Incan urban planning, governance).
- **The conquerors’ greed** is presented as a **moral failure**, not a triumph of civilization.

Ann Hartle (*Montaigne and the Origins of Modern Philosophy*, 2013) argues that this essay **anticipates Rousseau’s critique of inequality** by exposing the **violence at the heart of "civilization."**

#### **4. "Of Experience" (III.13): The Body as Ethical Teacher**
The final essay, *"Of Experience"* (III.13), is Montaigne’s **most sustained ethical statement**. Here, he rejects abstract moralizing in favor of **bodily wisdom**:
> *"We are great fools. ‘He has spent his life in idleness,’ we say; ‘I have done nothing today.’ What? Have you not lived? That is not only the fundamental but the most illustrious of your occupations."* (III.13)

This passage encapsulates Montaigne’s **ethics of limitation**:
- **Aging and illness** are not obstacles to wisdom but **its teachers**.
- **Pleasure and pain** are not distractions from morality but **its raw material**.
- **Death** is not to be feared but **studied** (as in *"That to philosophize is to learn to die,"* I.20).

Starobinski (*Montaigne in Motion*) argues that this essay **inverts the Platonic tradition**: where Plato (*Phaedo*) sought to escape the body, Montaigne **finds ethics in its vulnerabilities**.

#### **5. "Of Cruelty" (II.11): The Worst Vice**
In *"Of Cruelty"* (II.11), Montaigne identifies **cruelty as the most damning moral failure**, writing:
> *"I live in an age in which we abound in incredible examples of this vice, through the licentiousness of our civil wars; and read all the histories, ancient and modern, you will find no parallel to the horrors that are now practiced."* (II.11)

This essay is **radical in three ways**:
1. **Against torture**: Montaigne condemns judicial torture (common in 16th-century France) as **both ineffective and morally corrupting**.
2. **Against animal suffering**: He expresses **vegetarian sympathies**, writing:
   > *"I have not been able to see, without displeasure, an innocent and defenseless animal pursued and killed which has done us no harm."* (II.11)
   This is **remarkably early** in European thought (predating even Descartes’s *Discourse on Method*, 1637, which justified animal-machine theory).
3. **Against religious violence**: Montaigne’s critique of cruelty is **implicitly a critique of the Wars of Religion**, where cruelty was often justified in the name of God.

#### **6. Montaigne and the Wars of Religion: Ethics in a Time of Catastrophe**
Montaigne lived through the **French Wars of Religion (1562–1598)**, serving as mayor of Bordeaux (1581–1585) during active conflict. The *Essais* are, in part, a **response to this ethical catastrophe**. His friendship with Étienne de La Boétie (author of *Discourse on Voluntary Servitude*, 1576) shaped his thinking on **tyranny and resistance**.

Key tensions in Montaigne’s political ethics:
- **Skepticism vs. engagement**: Montaigne’s skepticism (*"Que sais-je?"*) could lead to **political quietism**, yet he served as mayor and negotiated between warring factions.
- **Tolerance vs. order**: He advocates **religious tolerance** (rare in his time) but also **supports strong monarchy** to prevent chaos.
- **Individualism vs. duty**: His ethics are **deeply personal**, yet he recognizes the need for **social bonds** (as in his essay *"Of Friendship,"* I.28, on his bond with La Boétie).

#### **7. Legacy: Montaigne to Pascal, Rousseau, Nietzsche, and Existentialism**
Montaigne’s influence on French ethical thought is **immense and contested**:
- **Pascal** (*Pensées*, 1670) engages with Montaigne’s skepticism but **rejects his complacency**, writing: *"The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not."* (Pascal, *Pensées*, §277)
- **Rousseau** (*Confessions*, 1782) adopts Montaigne’s **autobiographical ethics** but **rejects his irony**, seeking sincerity instead.
- **Nietzsche** (*Twilight of the Idols*, 1889) calls Montaigne *"the most liberated spirit"* but critiques his **lack of tragic grandeur**.
- **Existentialism** (Sartre, Camus) inherits Montaigne’s **emphasis on lived experience** and **radical freedom**.

The **essayistic tradition**—from Diderot’s *Rameau’s Nephew* (1762) to Barthes’s *Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes* (1975)—is **Montaigne’s most distinctive legacy**, offering a **French alternative to German systematic philosophy and British empiricism**.

#### **8. Key Scholars and Debates**
- **Hugo Friedrich** (*Montaigne*, 1949): Emphasizes Montaigne’s **modernity**, particularly his **subjectivity and skepticism**.
- **Jean Starobinski** (*Montaigne in Motion*, 1982): Focuses on the **kinetic, self-revising nature** of Montaigne’s thought.
- **Philippe Desan** (*Montaigne: A Life*, 2017): Provides a **biographical corrective**, showing how Montaigne’s ethics were shaped by **historical trauma**.
- **Ann Hartle** (*Montaigne and the Origins of Modern Philosophy*, 2013): Argues that Montaigne **anticipates modern philosophy’s turn to the subject**.

**Ongoing debates**:
- Was Montaigne a **skeptic** (as Richard Popkin argues) or a **fideist** (as some Catholic scholars claim)?
- Is his **relativism** a strength (allowing ethical flexibility) or a weakness (undermining moral judgment)?
- How does his **anti-colonialism** compare to later Enlightenment critiques (e.g., Diderot, Raynal)?

### **Conclusion: Montaigne’s Ethical Revolution**
Montaigne’s *Essais* are **not a system but a method**—one that **privileges doubt over certainty, experience over abstraction, and self-examination over dogma**. His ethics are **provisional, embodied, and deeply human**, offering a **French alternative to both medieval scholasticism and Enlightenment rationalism**.

His **failures** are as instructive as his achievements:
- His **political caution** sometimes verged on complicity (e.g., his service to the monarchy).
- His **relativism** could lead to **moral paralysis** (a critique later leveled by Pascal).
- His **focus on the self** risked **narcissism** (a charge Rousseau would later make).

Yet his **achievements** are foundational:
- The **invention of the personal essay** as an ethical form.
- The **first sustained critique of European colonialism** from within European thought.
- A **morality of attention**—to the body, to suffering, to the foreign—that remains **radically relevant**.

As Starobinski writes, Montaigne’s ethics are **not a doctrine but a practice**: *"To essay is to test, to weigh, to hesitate, to correct oneself."* In a world of **dogmatism and violence**, this **ethics of hesitation** may be his most enduring gift.

## France and West Africa: An Ethical History of Harm, Care, and Stewardship

France's relationship with West and Equatorial Africa is a complex and often contradictory ethical history, marked by colonial exploitation, liberation movements, neocolonial entanglements, and ongoing struggles for sovereignty. This history reveals a tension between France's self-proclaimed universalist ideals and the realities of its imperial project, and raises fundamental questions about responsibility, justice, and the legacies of colonialism.

### 1. The Colonial System and its Ethical Failures

French colonial expansion in West and Equatorial Africa, formalized during the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, established a system of direct rule in colonies like Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, and Gabon, and protectorates like Tunisia and Morocco. While protectorates nominally maintained their own rulers, French administrators wielded significant power, controlling foreign policy, defense, and key economic sectors. The ethical foundation of this system was deeply flawed, resting on a hierarchical worldview that denied Africans full humanity and justified their subjugation.

One of the most egregious aspects of the colonial system was the *indigénat*, a set of laws applied to "natives" (indigènes) in French colonies from 1881 to 1946. This parallel legal system denied Africans the basic rights and protections afforded to French citizens. As historian Gregory Mann explains in "Native Sons" (2003), the *indigénat* "represented a fundamental departure from republican principles of equality before the law." Colonial subjects could be summarily punished for offenses that would not even be considered crimes for Europeans, and they lacked the right to due process. This system was justified by a racist ideology that viewed Africans as incapable of self-governance and in need of European tutelage.

Forced labor, or *travail forcé*, was another cornerstone of the colonial economy. Until its official abolition in 1946 under pressure from the *Loi Houphouët-Boigny*, colonial administrations compelled Africans to work on public works projects, plantations, and mines, often under brutal conditions. This system extracted immense wealth from Africa while inflicting immense suffering on its people. The hypocrisy of this system was starkly exposed during World War II, when African soldiers, the *tirailleurs sénégalais*, fought and died to liberate France from Nazi occupation. Yet, upon their return home, they were denied the same rights and recognition as their French counterparts. The Thiaroye massacre of 1944, in which French troops killed dozens of Senegalese *tirailleurs* who were protesting delayed payment of their back pay, stands as a symbol of this betrayal. As historian Myron Echenberg details in "Colonial Conscripts" (1991), the massacre was a deliberate act of violence designed to reassert colonial authority and suppress any challenges to the existing order.

### 2. Léopold Sédar Senghor and the Ambiguities of Négritude

In response to the dehumanizing effects of colonialism, a generation of African intellectuals and artists developed the concept of *Négritude*. Léopold Sédar Senghor, along with Aimé Césaire and Léon-Gontran Damas, articulated *Négritude* as a literary, philosophical, and political movement that sought to reclaim and celebrate African identity, culture, and values. Senghor's poetry, as seen in "Chants d'ombre" (1945) and "Hosties noires" (1948), expressed a deep love for Africa and a rejection of the racist stereotypes perpetuated by colonial discourse. He envisioned an "African socialism" that would combine modern development with traditional African values of community, solidarity, and spirituality.

However, *Négritude* was not without its critics. Some, like Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka, saw it as an essentialist and romanticized view of African identity, famously declaring that "a tiger does not proclaim his tigritude, he pounces." Others questioned Senghor's continued attachment to French language and culture, arguing that it represented a form of cultural assimilation. Despite these criticisms, Senghor's *Négritude* played a significant role in inspiring anti-colonial movements and fostering a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans. As President of Senegal from 1960 to 1980, Senghor attempted to translate his vision of African socialism into policy, but his government was also criticized for its authoritarian tendencies and its close ties to France.

### 3. Françafrique: Neocolonial Control and its Discontents

After formal independence, France maintained a strong influence over its former colonies through a system known as *Françafrique*. This network, orchestrated by Jacques Foccart under Presidents de Gaulle and Pompidou, involved a complex web of political, economic, and military ties that allowed France to exert considerable control over its former colonies. François-Xavier Verschave's book "La Françafrique: Le plus long scandale de la République" (1998) provides a critical exposé of this system, detailing the ways in which France supported authoritarian regimes in exchange for access to resources and geopolitical alignment.

One of the key instruments of *Françafrique* was the CFA franc, a currency used by 14 African countries and pegged to the euro. While proponents argued that the CFA franc provided monetary stability, critics contend that it represented a form of monetary colonialism, as the reserves of these countries were held in the French Treasury and France had significant influence over their monetary policies. France also maintained military bases in several African countries, allowing it to intervene militarily in the region to protect its interests and prop up friendly regimes. The *Françafrique* network fostered a culture of corruption and impunity, as French companies and officials benefited from preferential access to resources and contracts, while African leaders were often rewarded for their loyalty to France with political and financial support.

### 4. The Rwandan Genocide and the Limits of Humanitarianism

France's role in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 remains a highly contentious issue. While France launched *Opération Turquoise* with the stated aim of protecting civilians, critics argue that it was primarily designed to protect the Hutu regime that was responsible for the genocide. The Duclert Commission, established by President Macron in 2019, concluded in its 2021 report that France bore "overwhelming responsibilities" for failing to prevent the genocide. The commission found that France had been aware of the genocidal intentions of the Hutu regime but continued to support it for geopolitical reasons.

The Rwandan genocide raises fundamental questions about the limits of humanitarian intervention and the ethical responsibilities of powerful states. As Mahmood Mamdani argues in "When Victims Become Killers" (2001), the Rwandan genocide was the result of a complex history of colonialism, ethnic division, and political manipulation. France's role in this history, and its actions during the genocide, continue to be a source of deep anger and resentment in Rwanda.

### 5. Thomas Sankara: An Alternative Vision for Africa

Thomas Sankara, the revolutionary president of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987, offered a stark contrast to the leaders supported by *Françafrique*. Sankara was a charismatic and principled leader who sought to transform Burkina Faso through a radical program of self-reliance, anti-corruption, and social justice. He promoted women's rights, combatted desertification, and rejected foreign debt, arguing that it was a form of neocolonialism. Sankara's assassination in 1987, allegedly with the involvement of France and his successor Blaise Compaoré, was a major setback for progressive forces in Africa. The trial of Compaoré in 2022, which resulted in a life sentence for his role in Sankara's murder, was a significant victory for justice and a symbolic rejection of *Françafrique*.

### 6. Contemporary Challenges: "France Dehors" and the Shifting Landscape

In recent years, France's influence in West Africa has been waning. The withdrawal of French forces from Mali in 2022, followed by similar moves in Burkina Faso and Niger, reflects a growing anti-French sentiment in the region. The "France dehors" (France get out) movement, fueled by social media and popular protests, accuses France of continuing to exploit its former colonies and interfering in their internal affairs.

The CFA franc reform, which renamed the currency the "eco," has been hailed as a step towards greater monetary sovereignty, but the fundamental issues of reserve management and French influence remain unresolved. France is also facing increasing competition from other global powers, such as Russia, China, and Turkey, who are offering African countries alternative models of development and security cooperation. This shift in the geopolitical landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for Africa, as it seeks to chart its own course in the 21st century.

### 7. Conclusion

France's ethical history in West and Equatorial Africa is a complex and contested narrative, marked by both acts of exploitation and moments of solidarity. The legacies of colonialism, *Françafrique*, and the Rwandan genocide continue to shape the relationship between France and Africa, as do the ongoing struggles for sovereignty, justice, and development. As African scholars like Achille Mbembe and Felwine Sarr argue, Africa must reclaim its own narrative and forge its own path towards a future of Afrotopia – a future of self-determination and sustainable development.

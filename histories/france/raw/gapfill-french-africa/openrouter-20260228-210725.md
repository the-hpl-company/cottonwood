### **France and Africa: An Ethical History of Colonialism, Decolonization, and Neocolonialism**  

#### **1. The Colonial System: Legalized Oppression**  
France’s colonial rule in West and Equatorial Africa (late 19th–mid 20th century) was structured through **direct rule (colonies)** and **indirect rule (protectorates)**. The **Code de l’indigénat** (1881–1946) created a separate legal system for colonial subjects, denying them citizenship rights while imposing forced labor (*travail forcé*), head taxes, and arbitrary punishment (Betts 1961, *Assimilation and Association in French Colonial Theory*).  

- **Forced Labor**: Officially abolished in 1946 (Lamine Guèye Law), but persisted in practice (Cooper 1996, *Decolonization and African Society*).  
- **Thiaroye Massacre (1944)**: French troops killed Senegalese *tirailleurs* (African soldiers) who demanded back pay after fighting for France in WWII (Echenberg 1991, *Colonial Conscripts*). The hypocrisy was stark: African soldiers liberated France but remained colonial subjects.  

#### **2. Léopold Sédar Senghor: Negritude and Ethical Ambivalence**  
Senghor (1906–2001), co-founder of **Negritude** with Aimé Césaire and Léon-Gontran Damas, articulated an African humanism in works like *Chants d’ombre* (1945) and *Hosties noires* (1948), which mourned African soldiers sacrificed for France.  

- **African Socialism**: As Senegal’s president (1960–1980), he promoted a hybrid of African communal values and French republican ideals.  
- **Critique by Wole Soyinka**: "A tiger does not proclaim his tigritude" (*Myth, Literature, and the African World*, 1976) challenged Negritude’s essentialism and Senghor’s Francophilia.  

#### **3. Francafrique: Neocolonial Control**  
Post-independence, France maintained dominance through **Jacques Foccart**, architect of **Françafrique**—a shadow network of economic, military, and political control (Verschave 1998, *La Françafrique: Le plus long scandale de la République*).  

- **CFA Franc**: Created in 1945, pegged to the French franc (later euro), requiring African states to deposit 50% of reserves in the French Treasury (Pigeaud & Sylla 2018, *L’arme invisible de la Françafrique*).  
- **Support for Dictators**: France backed Omar Bongo (Gabon, 1967–2009), Gnassingbé Eyadéma (Togo, 1967–2005), and Paul Biya (Cameroon, 1982–present) in exchange for uranium, oil, and geopolitical loyalty.  

#### **4. Rwanda: France’s "Overwhelming Responsibilities"**  
France armed and trained Hutu extremists before the 1994 genocide (Braeckman 1994, *Rwanda: Histoire d’un génocide*).  

- **Operation Turquoise (1994)**: Framed as humanitarian, it allowed génocidaires to escape (Prunier 1995, *The Rwanda Crisis*).  
- **Duclert Report (2021)**: Found France "blind" to impending genocide and complicit in sustaining Hutu Power (French government archives, 2021).  

#### **5. Thomas Sankara: The Anti-Françafrique Revolutionary**  
As Burkina Faso’s president (1983–1987), Sankara rejected IMF debt, promoted women’s rights (1984 ban on FGM), and advocated food self-sufficiency (*"Produisons ce que nous consommons"*).  

- **Assassination (1987)**: Orchestrated by Blaise Compaoré with French complicity (Harsch 2013, *Thomas Sankara: An African Revolutionary*). Compaoré’s 2022 trial (in absentia) confirmed long-standing suspicions.  

#### **6. Contemporary Reckoning: "France Dehors"**  
- **Military Withdrawals**: France exited Mali (2022), Burkina Faso (2023), Niger (2023) after coups and protests.  
- **CFA "Reform" (2019)**: Renamed "eco," but reserves still held in Paris.  
- **Declining Influence**: Russia (Wagner Group), China (Belt and Road), and Turkey (Islamic solidarity) fill the void.  

#### **7. Key Scholars**  
- **Achille Mbembe** (*Critique of Black Reason*, 2017) on colonial continuities.  
- **Felwine Sarr** (*Afrotopia*, 2016) on African self-reinvention.  
- **François-Xavier Verschave** exposed Françafrique’s corruption.  
- **Gregory Mann** (*From Empires to NGOs*, 2015) on postcolonial humanitarianism.  

**Conclusion**: France’s ethical failures—colonial violence, Françafrique, Rwanda—are now met with African resistance. The future hinges on whether France acknowledges its past or clings to diminished influence.

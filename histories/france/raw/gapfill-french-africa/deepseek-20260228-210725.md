### **France and Africa: An Ethical History of Colonialism, Decolonization, and Neocolonial Ties**

France’s relationship with West and Equatorial Africa constitutes a profound ethical narrative defined by the imposition of a hierarchical civilizing mission, violent extraction, a fraught and incomplete decolonization, and the persistence of asymmetric power structures. This history is marked by a persistent tension between republican universalist ideals and the systematic denial of those ideals to African subjects and citizens.

#### **1. The Colonial Ethical System: Legalized Inequality and Violence**
The French colonial project was structured on a fundamental ethical contradiction: the export of *les droits de l’homme* alongside their deliberate suspension. The administrative distinction between **colonies** (under direct rule, e.g., Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire) and **protectorates** (with nominal local rulers, e.g., Morocco, Tunisia) was superficial compared to the unifying regime of the **indigénat**.

*   **The Indigénat (1887-1946):** Codified by decree, this was a parallel legal system for "native subjects" (*sujets*), distinct from "citizens" (*citoyens*). It allowed summary punishment for a list of infractions (e.g., "disrespect" to a colonial official) without due process. The **Code de l'indigénat** (formally established in 1887 and renewed until 1946) institutionalized a state of legal exception, denying basic liberties of movement, assembly, and speech.
*   **Forced Labor (*travail forcé*):** Formally abolished in France in 1848, forced labor was central to colonial economics until the **Loi Houphouët-Boigny** of April 11, 1946. The 1912 *Prestations* laws and later the *deuxième portion du contingent* conscripted millions for infrastructure and private company projects (like the Congo-Océan railway, where an estimated 15,000-20,000 died), constituting a system of state-sanctioned exploitation.
*   **The Thiaroye Massacre (December 1, 1944):** This event epitomizes the ethical breach at the heart of the colonial pact. Senegalese *tirailleurs* (sharpshooters), veterans who had fought for France’s liberation, were detained at Thiaroye camp, Senegal, for demanding back pay and demobilization benefits. French troops, under General Dagnan, opened fire on them, killing at least 35 (estimates run higher). The survivors were later convicted of mutiny. Thiaroye laid bare the hypocrisy: Africans were called upon to sacrifice for France’s freedom while being denied the rights of the French citizen.

#### **2. Léopold Sédar Senghor: Negritude and the Ethics of Cultural Reclamation**
The anti-colonial ethical response found powerful expression in **Negritude**, a literary-philosophical movement co-founded by Senghor, Aimé Césaire, and Léon-Gontran Damas. It was an ethical and aesthetic reclaiming of African identity and value against racist colonial denigration.

*   **Senghor’s Poetic-Ethical Vision:** In collections like *Chants d’ombre* (1945) and *Hosties noires* (1948), Senghor articulated an African ontology of emotion, rhythm, and communion (*"La raison est hellène, l’émotion est nègre"*). His poem *"À l’appel de la race de Saba"* celebrated a shared African soul, while *"Tyaroye"* in *Hosties noires* memorialized the massacre, framing the *tirailleurs* as sacrificial "black hosts."
*   **The Ethical-Political Tension:** As first President of Senegal (1960-1980), Senghor promoted an **African socialism** rooted in communal African values. Yet his philosophy and governance maintained a deep attachment to French language and culture, advocating for a "Civilization of the Universal" that synthesized European and African *"apports."* This created an ethical and political tension: was Negritude a radical break or an assimilationist dialectic? Nigerian writer **Wole Soyinka** offered a famous critique in *Myth, Literature and the African World* (1976): *"A tiger does not proclaim his tigritude, he pounces."* For Soyinka, Negritude’s need to assert blackness remained trapped in a reactive, European-defined framework.

#### **3. Francafrique: The Neocolonial Ethical Regime**
Formal independence (1960 for most territories) gave way to **Francafrique**, a shadow system of continued domination, named and exposed by critics like **François-Xavier Verschave** (*La Francafrique: Le plus long scandale de la République*, 1998).

*   **Architect and Network:** **Jacques Foccart**, Secretary-General for African and Malagasy Affairs under de Gaulle and Pompidou (1960-1974), institutionalized a network blending state, business, and intelligence services. Its ethical core was the exchange of French political-military support for authoritarian clients in exchange for guaranteed access to strategic resources (oil, uranium, cocoa) and UN votes.
*   **Monetary Colonialism – The CFA Franc:** Created in 1945 as the *Colonies Françaises d’Afrique* franc, its mechanisms ensured continued control. Two central banks (BCEAO for West Africa, BEAC for Central Africa) were obliged to deposit **50% of their foreign reserves** in the French Treasury (the *"compte d’opération"*), while France guaranteed convertibility and held a veto on monetary boards. This system severely limited sovereign economic policy for 14 countries.
*   **Military and Political Support:** French military bases (e.g., in Dakar, Abidjan, Libreville) and frequent interventions (e.g., in Chad under **Hissène Habré**, in Gabon to secure **Omar Bongo**, in Togo to install **Gnassingbé Eyadéma** after 1963 coup) acted as the guarantor of regimes friendly to Paris, often regardless of their human rights records.

#### **4. The Rwandan Genocide: France’s "Overwhelming Responsibilities"**
France’s role in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi represents a pivotal ethical catastrophe in its post-colonial history.

*   **Military and Political Support:** Throughout the 1990-1994 civil war, France provided extensive military training, arms, and diplomatic cover to the Hutu-led government of Juvénal Habyarimana, viewing it as a bulwark against Anglophone (Ugandan) influence and the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).
*   **Operation Turquoise (June-August 1994):** Launched after the genocide had been ongoing for three months, this UN-mandated intervention created a "safe zone" in southwestern Rwanda. It has been contested as a **"humanitarian alibi"** (Verschave), as it arguably allowed *génocidaires* to escape into Zaire. The ethical framing of a humanitarian rescue was deeply compromised by France’s prior alliance with the perpetrators.
*   **The Duclert Commission Report (2021):** Commissioned by President Macron, this landmark historical report concluded France bore **"overwhelming responsibilities"** for being "blind" to the preparation of genocide and maintaining its alliance with a racist, genocidal regime. It found no evidence of French complicity in the genocide itself but constituted an unprecedented official reckoning.

#### **5. Thomas Sankara: The Anti-Francafrique Ethic**
**Thomas Sankara**, President of Burkina Faso (1983-1987), embodied a radical ethical alternative to Francafrique.

*   **His Ethical-Political Framework:** He championed **autosuffisance** (food self-sufficiency), mass vaccination, women’s rights (banning FGM, appointing women to high office), environmental stewardship, and a fierce rejection of foreign debt and IMF/World Bank structural adjustment. His symbolic acts, like selling the government fleet of Mercedes, were direct attacks on the corruption and dependency fostered by neocolonialism.
*   **Assassination and Legacy:** Sankara was assassinated on October 15, 1987, in a coup led by his former colleague **Blaise Compaoré**, who subsequently ruled for 27 years as a key French ally in the region. The trial for Sankara’s murder, culminating in Compaoré’s *in absentia* conviction in April 2022, directly linked his death to the restoration of the Francafrique system. Sankara remains the paradigmatic figure of a sovereign, pan-African, and ethically rigorous governance that France’s neocolonial structure could not tolerate.

#### **6. Contemporary Reckoning: "France Dehors" and Strategic Decline**
The early 21st century has seen a collapse of French ethical and political capital, leading to a strategic retreat.

*   **Military Withdrawals:** The failure of **Operation Barkhane** (2014-2022) to secure the Sahel, coupled with rising anti-French sentiment, led to the expulsion of French forces from **Mali (2022), Burkina Faso (2023), and Niger (2023)** following coups. The slogan **"France dehors"** (France out) reflects a widespread perception of France as a predatory, paternalist force.
*   **CFA Franc Reform:** Under pressure, France agreed to a 2019 reform: the **CFA** became the **Eco** in West Africa, and France withdrew its representatives from monetary boards. However, the requirement to keep **50% of reserves** in the French Treasury remains for the Central African bloc, leaving the core critique of monetary sovereignty unresolved.
*   **Strategic Competition:** This retreat has created a vacuum filled by **Russia** (Wagner Group), **Turkey**, and **China**, which offer security or investment partnerships without the historical baggage—though often introducing new forms of dependency.

#### **7. Key Scholarly Frameworks**
*   **Achille Mbembe (*Critique de la raison nègre*, 2013):** Analyzes the construction of "the Negro" as a category of racial capitalism and argues for a politics of **"afropolitanism"** beyond the colonial wound.
*   **Felwine Sarr (*Afrotopia*, 2016):** Calls for Africa to delink from Western epistemic and economic models to invent its own future, an ethical project of self-determination.
*   **Grégory Mann (*From Empires to NGOs*, 2015):** Examines the historical networks and human legacies connecting France and Mali, tracing the longue durée of intimate yet unequal ties.

**Conclusion:** France’s ethical history in Africa is one of a professed universalism consistently betrayed by practices of exclusion, extraction, and domination. From the *indigénat* to Francafrique, the pattern has been the maintenance of a hierarchical order. The contemporary moment represents a profound crisis for this order, driven by African popular rejection and the enduring legacy of figures like Sankara, forcing a long-overdue, and still incomplete, reckoning.

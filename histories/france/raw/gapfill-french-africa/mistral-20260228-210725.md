### **France’s Ethical History with West and Equatorial Africa: Colonialism, Decolonization, and Neocolonialism**

France’s relationship with West and Equatorial Africa is a history of **exploitation, resistance, and unresolved ethical contradictions**—from the violent imposition of colonial rule to the persistence of neocolonial structures under the guise of partnership. This history is marked by **hypocrisy** (liberty for some, subjugation for others), **cultural ambivalence** (the tension between assimilation and rejection of French dominance), and **ongoing struggles** over sovereignty, economic justice, and historical accountability.

## **1. The Colonial System: Direct Rule, the *Indigénat*, and Forced Labor**

France’s colonial empire in Africa was structured through two primary legal frameworks:
- **Colonies (direct rule):** Administered under French law, with African subjects classified as *sujets* (subjects) rather than *citoyens* (citizens). This included **Algeria (1830–1962), Senegal (1850s–1960), Ivory Coast (1893–1960), and French Equatorial Africa (AEF, 1910–1960).**
- **Protectorates (indirect rule):** Nominally sovereign but under French control, including **Tunisia (1881–1956), Morocco (1912–1956), and Madagascar (1896–1960).**

### **The *Code de l’Indigénat* (1881–1946): A Parallel Legal System of Oppression**
The **1881 *Décret sur le régime disciplinaire et pénal applicable aux indigènes*** (Decree on Disciplinary and Penal Regime Applicable to Natives) established a **two-tiered legal system** that denied Africans basic rights. Under this code:
- **Colonial administrators could impose arbitrary punishments** (fines, forced labor, imprisonment) without trial.
- **Collective punishment** was legalized—entire villages could be fined or destroyed for the actions of individuals.
- **Freedom of movement was restricted**—Africans needed permits to travel within their own countries.
- **Political organizing was criminalized**—any gathering of more than five people could be dispersed by force.

The *Indigénat* was **formally abolished in 1946** (under the **Loi Houphouët-Boigny**, named after the Ivorian leader Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who later became a key Francophone African politician), but its legacy persisted in **administrative repression and economic exploitation**.

### **Forced Labor (*Travail Forcé*) and the *Prestation***
Despite France’s **1905 abolition of slavery in its colonies**, forced labor remained institutionalized:
- The **1912 *Prestation*** (a corvée system) required African men to perform **unpaid labor** for public works (roads, railways, plantations) for **10–15 days per year**. This was expanded during **World War I and II** to support France’s war efforts.
- The **1926 *Convention de Saint-Germain-en-Laye*** (signed by France and other colonial powers) **banned forced labor in theory** but allowed exceptions for "public works." In practice, **millions of Africans were conscripted** to build infrastructure (e.g., the **Congo-Ocean Railway, 1921–1934**, which killed **15,000–20,000 workers** from exhaustion, disease, and accidents).
- Forced labor was **officially abolished in 1946** (again under the **Loi Houphouët-Boigny**), but **coercive labor practices continued** under other names (e.g., "voluntary" labor programs).

### **The Thiaroye Massacre (1944): The Hypocrisy of Liberation**
During **World War II**, **140,000 African soldiers (*tirailleurs sénégalais*)** fought for France, suffering **heavy casualties** (e.g., at **Verdun, 1916; Monte Cassino, 1944**). Yet when the war ended, they were **denied equal pay, pensions, and citizenship**.

- In **November 1944**, **1,280 *tirailleurs***—demobilized in **Thiaroye, Senegal**—**protested unpaid wages and racial discrimination**. French colonial troops **opened fire**, killing **at least 35 (official count), possibly hundreds (eyewitness accounts)**.
- The massacre was **covered up**—officers were **never prosecuted**, and survivors were **imprisoned or executed**.
- The event was **memorialized in literature** (e.g., **Sembène Ousmane’s *Camp de Thiaroye*, 1988**) and **officially acknowledged by France only in 2014** (when President **François Hollande** admitted "blood was shed" but stopped short of an apology).

**Ethical Failure:** France **owed its liberation to African soldiers** but **denied them equality**, exposing the **racial hierarchy** at the heart of its colonial project.

## **2. Negritude and Senghor: Cultural Resistance and Political Ambivalence**

The **interwar and post-WWII period** saw the rise of **Negritude**, a **literary and philosophical movement** that **rejected French assimilation** and **reclaimed African identity**. Its leading figures—**Léopold Sédar Senghor (Senegal), Aimé Césaire (Martinique), and Léon-Gontran Damas (French Guiana)**—sought to **redefine Black dignity** in a world dominated by European racism.

### **Senghor’s Negritude: Poetry as Ethical and Aesthetic Resistance**
Senghor’s work **challenged colonial stereotypes** while **negotiating with French culture**:
- **Chants d’ombre (1945)** – A collection of poems that **celebrates African spirituality, rhythm, and oral traditions**, contrasting them with European rationalism.
  - *"Je suis de la race de ceux qu’on opprime"* ("I am of the race of the oppressed") – **a direct rejection of colonial subjugation**.
- **Hosties noires (1948)** – A **tribute to African soldiers** who died for France, exposing the **betrayal of Thiaroye**:
  - *"Vous Tirailleurs Sénégalais, mes frères noirs à la main chaude sous la glace et la mort"* ("You Senegalese Tirailleurs, my Black brothers with warm hands under ice and death").
- **Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache (1948, co-edited with Césaire)** – A **foundational text of Negritude**, featuring poets from Africa and the diaspora.

### **Senghor’s African Socialism: Between Pan-Africanism and Francophonie**
As **President of Senegal (1960–1980)**, Senghor **promoted a hybrid ideology**:
- **"African Socialism"** – A **non-Marxist, communitarian socialism** rooted in African traditions (e.g., *teranga*, Senegalese hospitality).
- **"Civilization of the Universal"** – Senghor argued that **African and European cultures should merge**, but critics saw this as **a justification for continued French influence**.
- **Francophonie** – Senghor **championed the French language** as a tool for African unity, but this **alienated those who saw it as neocolonial**.

### **Critiques of Negritude: Soyinka’s "Tigritude" and Beyond**
- **Wole Soyinka (Nigerian playwright and Nobel laureate)** famously mocked Negritude:
  - *"A tiger does not proclaim his tigritude, he pounces."* – **Negritude, in his view, was too focused on cultural affirmation rather than political action.**
- **Frantz Fanon (Martinican psychiatrist and revolutionary, *The Wretched of the Earth*, 1961)** argued that **Negritude was a necessary but insufficient step**—true liberation required **violent decolonization**.
- **Cheikh Anta Diop (*Nations nègres et culture*, 1954)** criticized Senghor for **overemphasizing cultural resistance** while **ignoring economic exploitation**.

**Ethical Tension:** Senghor **reclaimed African dignity** but **remained entangled with France**, embodying the **ambivalence of postcolonial elites** who **resisted colonialism while benefiting from its structures**.

## **3. Françafrique: The System of Neocolonial Control**

After formal independence (1960), France **retained economic, military, and political dominance** through **Françafrique**—a **shadow network** of **corporate, intelligence, and diplomatic ties** that **undermined African sovereignty**.

### **Jacques Foccart: The Architect of Françafrique**
- **Jacques Foccart (1913–1997)**, **De Gaulle’s "Mr. Africa" (1958–1974)**, built a **parallel foreign policy** that **bypassed official channels**.
- His **strategy included**:
  - **Supporting compliant dictators** (e.g., **Omar Bongo in Gabon, Gnassingbé Eyadéma in Togo, Paul Biya in Cameroon**) in exchange for **resource access (oil, uranium, cocoa)**.
  - **Military interventions** (e.g., **Gabon 1964, Chad 1968–1972, Central African Republic 1979**) to **protect French interests**.
  - **Assassinating or destabilizing leaders** who resisted (e.g., **Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso, 1987; Sylvanus Olympio in Togo, 1963**).

### **The CFA Franc: Monetary Colonialism**
- **1945:** The **Franc des Colonies Françaises d’Afrique (CFA)** was created, **pegged to the French franc** (and later the euro).
- **1960s:** After independence, **14 African countries** (8 in **West Africa (WAEMU)**, 6 in **Central Africa (CEMAC)**) **retained the CFA**, with **two key neocolonial features**:
  1. **Fixed exchange rate (1 euro = 655.96 CFA francs)** – **No monetary sovereignty**; African countries **cannot devalue their currency** to boost exports.
  2. **Foreign reserves held in France** – **50% of African foreign reserves** must be **deposited in the French Treasury** (a **colonial-era requirement** that **France only partially relaxed in 2020**).
- **2020 "Reform":** The **West African CFA was renamed the "eco"** (a planned future common currency for ECOWAS), but **France still guarantees its convertibility**, and **reserves remain in Paris**.

**Critics (e.g., Kako Nubukpo, *L’Urgence africaine*, 2019)** argue that the CFA **stifles African economic development** by **preventing independent monetary policy**.

### **Military Bases and Resource Extraction**
- **France maintains military bases in Africa** (e.g., **Dakar (Senegal), N’Djamena (Chad), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Djibouti**), justifying them as **"counterterrorism" or "stability" operations**.
- **Uranium from Niger** (which powers **1/3 of France’s nuclear reactors**) is **extracted by French company Orano (formerly Areva)**, with **minimal benefits for Nigeriens** (Niger remains **one of the poorest countries in the world**).
- **Oil from Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville** is **dominated by TotalEnergies**, with **profits flowing to France** while **local populations see little benefit**.

**Ethical Failure:** Françafrique **replaced direct colonial rule with economic and military control**, ensuring that **African independence was formal, not substantive**.

## **4. The Rwandan Genocide (1994): France’s "Overwhelming Responsibilities"**

France’s role in **Rwanda (1990–1994)** remains one of the **most controversial chapters** in its African policy.

### **Operation Turquoise (1994): "Humanitarian Intervention" or Complicity?**
- **April–July 1994:** The **Hutu-led Rwandan government** carried out a **genocide against the Tutsi minority**, killing **800,000 people in 100 days**.
- **France had long supported the Hutu regime**:
  - **Military training** for the **Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR)**.
  - **Arms shipments** (even after the genocide began).
  - **Diplomatic cover** at the UN.
- **June 1994:** France launched **Operation Turquoise**, a **UN-mandated "humanitarian" mission** to create a **"safe zone"** in southwestern Rwanda.
  - **Critics (e.g., Gérard Prunier, *The Rwanda Crisis*, 1995)** argue that **France’s real goal was to protect the genocidal government** and **prevent a Tutsi victory** (led by **Paul Kagame’s RPF**).
  - **Genocidaires fled through the "safe zone"** into **Zaire (now DRC)**, where they **reorganized and continued attacks**.

### **The Duclert Commission (2021): France’s "Overwhelming Responsibilities"**
- **2021:** President **Emmanuel Macron** commissioned a **report by historian Vincent Duclert** on France’s role in Rwanda.
- **Findings:**
  - France was **"blind" to the genocide** due to **ideological bias** (supporting Hutu extremists as "anti-imperialist").
  - **No evidence of direct French participation in genocide**, but **"overwhelming responsibilities"** due to **military, political, and diplomatic support** for the genocidal regime.
  - **Macron acknowledged "responsibility" but stopped short of an apology**.

**Ethical Catastrophe:** France’s **decades-long support for a genocidal regime**—and its **failure to prevent or stop the slaughter**—represents one of its **greatest moral failures in Africa**.

---

## **5. Thomas Sankara: The Anti-Françafrique Revolutionary**

**Thomas Sankara (1949–1987)**, President of **Burkina Faso (1983–1987)**, was **Françafrique’s most radical opponent**.

### **Sankara’s Ethical Framework: Anti-Corruption, Women’s Rights, and Self-Sufficiency**
- **1983:** Sankara led a **revolution** that **overthrew a corrupt, French-backed regime**.
- **Key policies:**
  - **Anti-corruption:** **Public trials for corrupt officials**, **confiscation of ill-gotten wealth**.
  - **Women’s rights:** **Banned female genital mutilation (FGM)**, **appointed women to high office**, **promoted education for girls**.
  - **Self-sufficiency:** **Rejected IMF/World Bank loans**, **promoted local agriculture** (e.g., **Burkina Faso became food self-sufficient in 3 years**).
  - **Debt rejection:** **Called for African countries to refuse foreign debt**, arguing it was **"a new form of colonialism."**
  - **Pan-Africanism:** **Supported liberation movements** (e.g., **ANC in South Africa, SWAPO in Namibia**).

### **Assassination and the Trial of Blaise Compaoré (2022)**
- **October 15, 1987:** Sankara was **assassinated in a coup** led by his **former ally Blaise Compaoré**, who **ruled Burkina Faso for 27 years** with **French support**.
- **2022:** A **military tribunal in Burkina Faso** convicted **Compaoré (in absentia) and 13 others** of **complicity in Sankara’s murder**.
- **France’s role remains disputed**—**declassified documents suggest French intelligence knew of the plot** but **did not intervene**.

**Ethical Legacy:** Sankara **embodied the possibility of a post-colonial Africa free from French domination**, making his **assassination a symbol of Françafrique’s brutality**.

## **6. Contemporary Shifts: "France Dehors" and the Decline of Françafrique**

Since the **2010s**, France’s influence in Africa has **declined sharply**, facing **growing anti-French sentiment** and **competition from Russia, China, and Turkey**.

### **The "France Dehors" Movement**
- **2020s:** Protests across **Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad** have demanded **"France dehors" (France out)**.
- **Key grievances:**
  - **Military presence:** France’s **counterterrorism operations (Barkhane, 2014–2022)** were **seen as ineffective and neocolonial**.
  - **Economic exploitation:** The **CFA franc, uranium deals, and corporate dominance** are **increasingly rejected**.
  - **Historical grievances:** **Unresolved colonial crimes** (e.g., **Thiaroye, Algerian War massacres**) fuel resentment.

### **Military Withdrawals and New Alliances**
- **2022:** France **withdrew troops from Mali** after **coups in 2020 and 2021** brought **anti-French juntas to power**.
- **2023:** **Burkina Faso and Niger** (both under military rule) **expelled French troops** and **turned to Russia’s Wagner Group** for security.
- **2024:** **Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso** formed the **Alliance of Sahel States (AES)**, a **military and economic bloc** that **rejects French influence**.

### **The CFA Franc Reform: Symbolic Change, Structural Continuity**
- **2020:** The **West African CFA was renamed the "eco"** (a planned future ECOWAS currency).
- **But

# French Ethical Thought, 1815–1940: The Crucible of Universalism and Empire

The 19th century and Third Republic (1870–1940) forged the central, unresolved tension of modern French ethics: the simultaneous, explosive expansion of **republican universalism** and **colonial empire**. This period transformed France from a post-revolutionary monarchy into a secular, democratic republic defined by a "civilizing mission" that claimed to uplift humanity while systematically excluding and subjugating millions. The ethical tradition is not one of consistency, but of profound, generative contradiction.

## 1. Alexis de Tocqueville: The Architect of Democratic and Colonial Ethics

**Primary Texts:** *De la démocratie en Amérique* (Vol. I, 1835; Vol. II, 1840); *Travail sur l’Algérie* (1841); *Rapports sur l’Algérie* (1847).

Tocqueville’s ethical thought is bifurcated. In *Democracy in America*, he provides the definitive analysis of democratic society’s ethical foundations: the "equality of conditions," the tyranny of the majority, the role of associations, and the "habits of the heart" (*moeurs*) necessary for liberty. He warns of democratic individualism’s potential to erode civic virtue, creating isolated atoms vulnerable to despotism.

Yet, in his Algerian writings, Tocqueville applies a different ethical calculus. After visiting Algeria in 1841 and 1846, he became a forceful advocate for colonization, seeing it as essential for France’s greatness. In his 1841 *Travail sur l’Algérie*, he argues: **"I believe that the right of war authorizes us to ravage the country and that we must do so, either by destroying harvests during the harvest season, or year-round by making those rapid incursions called *razzias*, whose aim is to seize men or herds."** He supported the brutal tactics of General Bugeaud, including the suffocation of hundreds of Algerians in the Dahra caves (1845). For Tocqueville, colonialism was not a betrayal of universalism but its necessary extension for a nation destined to spread civilization. The same thinker who diagnosed the ethical perils of democracy for Europeans justified conquest and collective punishment for Algerians. This is not personal hypocrisy but **the structural logic of liberal imperialism**: universal rights are predicated on a stage of civilization that colonized peoples are deemed not to have attained.

## 2. The Paris Commune (18 March – 28 May 1871): The Ethics of Insurrection

**Primary Documents:** The Commune’s decrees (e.g., separation of church and state, moratorium on rent, worker control of abandoned workshops); Louise Michel’s *Mémoires* (1886); Karl Marx’s *The Civil War in France* (1871).

For 72 days, the Commune enacted the most radical ethical experiment of the century. Its program was a living critique of the conservative, bourgeois ethics of the Third Republic just born at Versailles. Its ethical innovations included:
- **The ethical separation of church and state** (decree of 2 April 1871), removing religious influence from public education and state funding from clergy.
- **The ethics of economic justice**: decrees establishing workers' cooperatives to take over abandoned businesses, a moratorium on rent and commercial debt.
- **The ethics of direct democracy**: all officials subject to recall, a maximum salary for public servants.
- **The ethics of gender equality**: women like **Louise Michel** ("the Red Virgin") were central as fighters, organizers, and theorists. The *Union des femmes pour la défense de Paris* demanded gender equality in work and pay.

The **Bloody Week** (*Semaine Sanglante*, 21–28 May 1871) saw the Versailles government under Adolphe Thiers massacre approximately 10,000–20,000 Communards in the streets. The repression was an ethical watershed: the republican state demonstrated it would use extreme violence against its own working-class citizens to protect property and order. Louise Michel, at her trial, declared: **"I belong entirely to the social revolution, and I declare that I accept responsibility for all my acts... If you let me live, I shall never cease to cry for vengeance."** The Commune became the foundational ethical reference for the French and international left, a martyrdom symbolizing both the possibility of emancipatory self-rule and the violent limits imposed by the bourgeois state.

## 3. Victor Hugo: The Literary Cathedral of Ethics

**Primary Texts:** *Les Misérables* (1862); *Histoire d’un crime* (1852, on Napoleon III’s coup); speeches on colonialism (e.g., on the 1885 Berlin Conference).

*Les Misérables* is the monumental novel of French ethics. Its architecture is built on three pillars:
- **Jean Valjean**: The ethics of **redemption and grace**, triggered by the Bishop of Digne’s gift of silver candlesticks ("You no longer belong to evil, but to good").
- **Inspector Javert**: The ethics of **unyielding, positivist law**, incapable of comprehending mercy. His suicide represents the collapse of a legalistic ethic devoid of humanity.
- **The Bishop of Digne (Monseigneur Myriel)**: The ethics of **Christian mercy as a social force**, preceding and transcending state law.

Hugo, in political exile for opposing Napoleon III’s coup (1851), became the conscience of the republican opposition. On colonialism, his ethics were conflicted. He vehemently condemned slavery and the violence of empire, yet in a speech on the 1885 Berlin Conference (which partitioned Africa), he could also endorse a paternalistic vision: **"In the 19th century, the White made a man of the Black; in the 20th century, Europe will make a world of Africa... This Africa is a passive and drained land... She offers herself to those who come."** This captures the era’s dominant ethical blind spot: even the most humane universalists often subscribed to a hierarchical, progressive view of history that justified European stewardship.

## 4. The Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906): The Ethical Crucible of Modern France

**Primary Documents:** Emile Zola’s **"J’Accuse…!"** (*L’Aurore*, 13 January 1898); Alfred Dreyfus’s *Cinq années de ma vie* (1901); the Law of 9 December 1905 on Separation of Churches and State.

The Affair was a twelve-year national convulsion that forced a choice between two ethical systems:
- **The ethics of reason, justice, and truth** (Dreyfusards): Defended by intellectuals like Zola, who in "J’Accuse" directly named generals and ministers for perpetrating a "crime of *lèse-humanité*." He staked the intellectual’s ethical duty: **"My duty is to speak; I do not wish to be an accomplice."**
- **The ethics of order, authority, and tribe** (Anti-Dreyfusards): Defended by the Army, the Catholic Church, and nationalists like Maurice Barrès, for whom the "reason of state" and the honor of the institution trumped the individual justice of a Jewish officer.

The Affair crystallized modern French antisemitism (exemplified by Édouard Drumont’s *La France juive*, 1886) and created the modern **intellectual as a public moral figure**. It directly led to the 1905 law of *laïcité*, as republicans sought to break the political power of the anti-Dreyfusard Catholic Church. The ethical division became the foundational split between the **"two Frances"**—republican, secular, universalist vs. authoritarian, Catholic, nationalist—a fault line extending through Vichy to today.

## 5. Laïcité (1905): The Ethics of Militant Secularism

**Primary Text:** *Loi du 9 décembre 1905 concernant la séparation des Églises et de l’État*.

*Laïcité* is not mere separation of church and state (as in the U.S. First Amendment). It is an **active, ethical project to construct a secular public sphere** and transfer moral education from the church to the state school. Its principles:
- **Article 1**: "The Republic assures freedom of conscience. It guarantees the free exercise of religions."
- **Article 2**: "The Republic does not recognize, salary, or subsidize any religion."

The ethical framework, shaped by **Jules Ferry’s education laws (1881-82)**, held that the republican school—**free, compulsory, secular** (*gratuité, obligation, laïcité*)—was the forge of citizen virtue, replacing religious dogma with civic morality and reason. It protected the individual from clerical oppression and aimed to create a unified public space of shared citizenship. However, from its inception, it suppressed public expressions of religious identity, viewing them as threats to republican unity. This **"combative secularism"** (*laïcité de combat*) was directed first at the Catholic Church but established a template for regulating all faiths in the public square, an ethical stance with profound consequences for 21st-century debates over Islam.

## 6. The "Mission Civilisatrice": The Ethical Claim of Empire

**Primary Texts/Documents:** The **Crémieux Decree** (24 October 1870); Jules Ferry’s speech before the Chamber of Deputies (28 July 1885); Frantz Fanon’s *Les Damnés de la Terre* (1961, Préface by Jean-Paul Sartre).

Colonialism was justified as an ethical duty. Jules Ferry argued: **"The superior races have a right vis-à-vis the inferior races… they have a duty to civilize the inferior races."** This "civilizing mission" promised to bring rights, education, and progress, but its logic was inherently discriminatory.

The **Crémieux Decree** granted French citizenship to Algeria’s 35,000 Jews while explicitly denying it to Muslims, who were governed by the **Code de l’indigénat** (1881), a separate legal regime of punitive administrative sanctions. This created a tripartite ethical hierarchy: **Citizens** (settlers and Jews), **Subjects** (Muslims), and the **Indigenous Code**. The promise of assimilation was real but required the renunciation of personal status (e.g., Islamic law).

The most devastating ethical indictment came from within the French intellectual tradition: **Frantz Fanon**, a psychiatrist from Martinique trained in Lyon. In *The Wretched of the Earth* (1961), he dissected the colonial world as a **"Manichean"** division enforced by violence: **"The colonial world is a world cut in two… inhabited by two different species."** He argued that colonial violence dehumanizes both colonizer and colonized, and that revolutionary counter-violence is a necessary catharsis for the colonized to reclaim their humanity. Sartre’s preface endorsed this, shocking the French left: **"To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone… there remains a dead man and a free man."** Fanon exposed the "mission civilisatrice" as a violent fraud, turning the universalist language of the Republic against itself.

## 7. Auguste Comte & Positivism: The Ethics of Science and Society

**Primary Texts:** Auguste Comte’s *Cours de philosophie positive* (1830-42) and *Système de politique positive* (1851-54); Émile Durkheim’s *De la division du travail social* (1893) and *Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse* (1912).

Comte sought to replace theological and metaphysical ethics with a **"positivist"** ethics based on scientific observation and sociology. He proposed a **"Religion of Humanity"** with secular saints, a calendar of benefactors, and a moral order administered by a sociologist-priesthood. His motto: **"Order and Progress"** (which became Brazil’s national motto, showing his influence in Latin America).

**Émile Durkheim**, Comte’s intellectual heir, secularized morality further. He argued in *The Division of Labor in Society* that morality arises from social cohesion (*solidarité*). In modern societies, **organic solidarity** (interdependence) replaces **mechanical solidarity** (shared belief). His sociology treated moral facts as social facts to be studied empirically. This project sought to ground republican ethics in social science, providing a secular basis for the moral education championed by Ferry’s schools, making sociology a discipline for diagnosing and repairing anomie in modern society.

## 8. Key Scholarly Interpretations

- **Pierre Nora** (*Les Lieux de mémoire*, 1984-92): Analyzes how the Republic constructed its ethical identity through "sites of memory" (the Pantheon, the 14th of July), ritualizing the universalist narrative while often excluding colonial and social conflict.
- **Sudhir Hazareesingh** (*How the French Think*, 2015; *The Legend of Napoleon*, 2004): Traces the enduring ethical patterns in French political thought, particularly the tension between revolutionary universalism and the cult of the heroic leader.
- **Alice Conklin** (*A Mission to Civilize: The Republican Idea of Empire in France and West Africa, 1895-1930*, 1997): Demonstrates how the "civilizing mission" was the central, sincere ethical justification for colonial administrators, even as it masked exploitation.
- **Todd Shepard** (*The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France*, 2006): Shows how the end of empire forced a redefinition of French universalism, legally redefining citizenship to exclude Algerians after 1962.

**Conclusion: The Legacy of Contradiction**
The ethical tradition of 19th-century and Third Republic France is defined by the explosive tension between its **universalist claims** (the Rights of Man, *liberté-égalité-fraternité*, *laïcité*, democratic sociality) and its **particular exclusions** (colonial subjecthood, the repression of the Commune, the *indigénat*, the Dreyfusard "two Frances"). This is not a history of failed application but of constitutive contradiction. The same republican state that secularized education and defended Dreyfus also ravaged Algeria and massacred Communards. This tension—between emancipatory universalism and exclusionary violence—is the central, unresolved dialectic of modern French ethics, a legacy that continues to shape debates over immigration, secularism, and national identity today.

### **French Ethical Thought in the Long 19th Century (1815–1940): Universalism and Empire in Tension**

The 19th century in France was a period of profound ethical experimentation, defined by the paradox of **republican universalism**—the claim to embody liberty, equality, and fraternity for all humanity—while simultaneously constructing and justifying a **colonial empire** that systematically violated those principles. This tension was not incidental but structural: the same intellectual frameworks that produced radical democratic ethics also provided the moral vocabulary for domination. Below, we trace this contradiction through key thinkers, movements, and crises, centering the ways in which French ethical thought both expanded and betrayed its own ideals.

---

## **1. Alexis de Tocqueville: Democracy’s Prophet and Colonialism’s Architect**
### **Democracy in America (1835, 1840) – The Ethical Promise of Equality**
Tocqueville’s *De la démocratie en Amérique* is one of the most penetrating analyses of democratic society ever written. He identified democracy not merely as a political system but as a **moral condition**, one that dissolved aristocratic hierarchies and replaced them with a new ethic of **equality of conditions** (*égalité des conditions*). His key ethical insights include:
- **The tyranny of the majority**: Democracy risks suppressing dissent in the name of collective will (*Democracy in America*, Vol. 1, Ch. 15).
- **Associational life**: Civil society (churches, clubs, newspapers) acts as a **moral counterweight** to state power (Vol. 2, Part 2, Ch. 5).
- **The democratic soul**: Equality fosters a restless, individualistic ethos that can lead to both **liberation and alienation** (Vol. 2, Part 2, Ch. 13).

Tocqueville’s work was not just descriptive but **normative**: he saw democracy as an **ethical imperative**, a system that, despite its flaws, was morally superior to aristocracy. Yet this same thinker would later provide the **intellectual justification for French colonialism in Algeria**.

### **Tocqueville on Algeria: The Ethics of Conquest (1837–1847)**
Tocqueville visited Algeria in 1841 and 1846, writing two **parliamentary reports** (*Rapport sur l’Algérie*, 1847) that defended French colonization. His arguments reveal how **universalist ethics could be mobilized for domination**:
- **"Civilizing mission"**: Algeria was a "barbaric" society that France had a **duty to transform** (*Rapport*, 1847, p. 5).
- **Justified violence**: He endorsed **collective punishment**, razing villages, and forced displacement of Algerians, arguing that "war in Africa is a science" (*Travail sur l’Algérie*, 1841).
- **Settler colonialism**: He advocated for **European immigration** to "regenerate" Algeria, even if it meant displacing the indigenous population.
- **Legal dualism**: He supported maintaining **separate legal systems** for Europeans and Muslims, ensuring colonial domination (*Rapport*, 1847, p. 22).

**The paradox**: The same thinker who warned against the **moral dangers of democratic conformity** saw no contradiction in justifying **racial hierarchy and state violence** in Algeria. This was not hypocrisy but **the structure of French universalism**: the Republic’s ideals were **selectively applied**, with "civilization" serving as a **moral alibi for conquest**.

## **2. The Paris Commune (1871): The Radical Ethics of Self-Governance**
The **Commune of Paris (March 18–May 28, 1871)** was the most radical **ethical experiment** of 19th-century Europe—a **worker-led government** that attempted to realize socialism in practice. Its suppression in **Bloody Week (May 21–28)** left **20,000 dead**, but its ideas became a **moral reference point** for the French left.

### **The Commune’s Ethical Program**
- **Laïcité before 1905**: The Commune **separated church and state**, secularized education, and expropriated church property (*Décret du 2 avril 1871*).
- **Workers’ cooperatives**: Factories abandoned by owners were **turned over to worker associations** (*Décret du 16 avril 1871*).
- **Feminist participation**: Women like **Louise Michel** (the "Red Virgin of Montmartre") fought on the barricades and demanded **gender equality** (*Mémoires de Louise Michel*, 1886).
- **Internationalism**: The Commune welcomed **foreign revolutionaries**, including Polish and Hungarian exiles.

### **The Ethical Legacy of the Commune**
- **Karl Marx** called it the **first "dictatorship of the proletariat"** (*The Civil War in France*, 1871).
- **Anarchists** (Bakunin, Kropotkin) saw it as proof that **stateless socialism** was possible.
- **The French left** (from Jaurès to the PCF) **revered it as a martyrdom**, a **moral example** of what the Republic could have been.
- **The right** (Thiers, MacMahon) **crushed it brutally**, framing it as a **moral threat** to order.

The Commune was **not just a political event but an ethical rupture**: it exposed the **limits of bourgeois republicanism** and offered an alternative vision of **care, solidarity, and collective stewardship**.

## **3. Victor Hugo: Les Misérables (1862) and the Ethics of Mercy**
Hugo’s *Les Misérables* is the **great ethical novel of 19th-century France**, a **moral universe** where law, mercy, and redemption collide.

### **The Ethical Architecture of Les Misérables**
| Character | Ethical Principle | Key Scene |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Jean Valjean** | **Redemption through mercy** | Stealing silver from the Bishop of Digne, who then **forgives him** and gives him candlesticks (*Book 2, Ch. 12*). |
| **Javert** | **Law as absolute duty** | Suicide when he cannot reconcile **justice and mercy** (*Book 5, Ch. 14*). |
| **Bishop Myriel** | **Christian charity as social justice** | "Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good." (*Book 1, Ch. 14*). |
| **Fantine** | **The vulnerability of the poor** | Selling her hair, teeth, and body to support her daughter (*Book 5*). |
| **Marius & Cosette** | **Love as ethical transformation** | Marius’s shift from royalism to republicanism (*Book 8*). |

### **Hugo’s Exile and Anti-Colonial Ambivalence**
- **Against Napoleon III**: Hugo **denounced the 1851 coup** in *Napoléon le Petit* (1852), calling Louis-Napoléon a **moral criminal**.
- **Against slavery**: He supported **Haitian independence** and **abolition** (*Discours sur la misère*, 1849).
- **For colonialism?**: He **supported French rule in Algeria**, arguing that France had a **civilizing mission** (*Choses vues*, 1846).

Hugo’s ethics were **universalist in aspiration but Eurocentric in practice**. His novel preached **mercy for the poor** but did not extend that mercy to **Algerians or Vietnamese** under French rule.

## **4. The Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906): The Ethical Crisis That Made Modern France**
The **Dreyfus Affair** was not just a **legal scandal** but a **moral earthquake** that redefined French identity. It pitted **justice against military honor**, **truth against nationalism**, and **universalism against antisemitism**.

### **Key Ethical Divisions**
| **Dreyfusards** | **Anti-Dreyfusards** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Émile Zola** ("J’accuse!", *L’Aurore*, 1898) | **Edouard Drumont** (*La France juive*, 1886) |
| **Georges Clemenceau** (defended Zola) | **Charles Maurras** (founded *Action Française*, 1899) |
| **Jean Jaurès** (socialist, pro-Dreyfus) | **General Mercier** (covered up evidence) |
| **Universalism, justice, laïcité** | **Nationalism, antisemitism, Catholic order** |

### **Zola’s "J’accuse!" (1898) as Ethical Manifesto**
Zola’s open letter to President Félix Faure was a **moral indictment** of the French state:
- **"Truth is on the march, and nothing will stop it."** (*L’Aurore*, Jan. 13, 1898)
- He accused the **army, judiciary, and government** of **perverting justice** to protect institutional honor.
- He framed the Affair as a **test of France’s soul**: Would it be a **Republic of rights** or a **nation of lies**?

### **The Affair’s Ethical Legacy**
- **Laïcité strengthened**: The Affair **discredited the Catholic Church**, which had sided with the anti-Dreyfusards. This paved the way for the **1905 Separation Law**.
- **Antisemitism exposed**: The Affair revealed **deep-seated antisemitism** in French society, later exploited by Vichy.
- **Intellectuals as moral guardians**: The term **"intellectual"** was **invented** during the Affair (used pejoratively by anti-Dreyfusards, reclaimed by Zola).
- **Colonial echoes**: The Affair showed how **universalism could be weaponized**—Dreyfus was **included in the nation** only after a **moral crusade**, while **Algerian Muslims remained excluded**.

---

## **5. Laïcité: The 1905 Law and the Ethics of Secularism**
The **1905 Law on the Separation of Churches and the State** (*Loi du 9 décembre 1905*) was the **culmination of a century of conflict** between the Republic and the Catholic Church. It established **laïcité**—not just **neutrality** but **active secularism**—as the **moral foundation of the Republic**.

### **Key Provisions of the 1905 Law**
- **Article 1**: "The Republic ensures freedom of conscience."
- **Article 2**: "It guarantees the free exercise of religion" **but** "does not recognize, pay, or subsidize any religion."
- **Article 4**: Church property **transferred to the state**, with religious associations allowed to use it.
- **Article 28**: **Banned religious symbols** in public buildings (later expanded to schools in 2004).

### **How Laïcité Differs from American Secularism**
| **French Laïcité** | **American Separation of Church and State** |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Militant secularism** (state actively limits religion in public sphere) | **Passive neutrality** (state does not favor any religion) |
| **Bans religious symbols in public schools** (2004 law) | **Allows religious expression** (e.g., student-led prayer) |
| **No state funding for churches** | **Tax exemptions for churches** |
| **Secularism as a civic religion** (replaces Catholic morality) | **Religious pluralism as a civic value** |

### **Jules Ferry and the Ethical Project of Secular Education**
Ferry’s **1881–1882 education laws** (*Lois Ferry*) made primary education **free, mandatory, and secular**. His **ethical vision**:
- **School as a moral institution**: "The teacher must be the **priest of the Republic**." (*Discours à la Chambre*, 1879)
- **Anti-clericalism**: "We must **de-Christianize** the French soul." (*Lettre aux instituteurs*, 1883)
- **Colonial justification**: Ferry argued that **education was France’s duty to "inferior races"** (*Discours sur le colonialisme*, 1885).

**The paradox**: The same Republic that **emancipated children from Catholic dogma** also **justified colonial domination** in the name of **civilization**.

---

## **6. The Colonial Project as Ethical Claim: The "Mission Civilisatrice"**
France’s **Third Republic (1870–1940)** was both the **high point of republican universalism** and the **peak of colonial expansion**. The **mission civilisatrice** ("civilizing mission") was the **moral justification** for empire: France had a **duty to bring progress** to "backward" peoples.

### **Key Colonial Ethical Justifications**
| **Argument** | **Text/Example** | **Critique** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Racial hierarchy** | Arthur de Gobineau, *Essai sur l’inégalité des races humaines* (1853) | Frantz Fanon, *The Wretched of the Earth* (1961): "The colonized is not a man; he is a **thing**." |
| **Assimilation** | Jules Ferry, *Discours sur le colonialisme* (1885): "Superior races have a right over inferior races." | Albert Memmi, *The Colonizer and the Colonized* (1957): Assimilation is a **myth**—colonized people are **never truly French**. |
| **Legal dualism** | **Crémieux Decree (1870)**: Granted **citizenship to Algerian Jews** but not Muslims. | Kateb Yacine, *Nedjma* (1956): "France gave us **two faces**: one for the colonizer, one for the colonized." |
| **Violence as pedagogy** | General Bugeaud’s **scorched-earth tactics** in Algeria (1840s) | Pierre Bourdieu, *Algeria 1960* (1972): Colonialism **destroys indigenous social structures**. |

### **Frantz Fanon: The Ethical Indictment of Colonialism**
Fanon’s *The Wretched of the Earth* (1961) was the **most devastating critique of French colonialism from within the French tradition**. His key arguments:
- **Colonialism is **violence in its purest form** (*Ch. 1*).
- **The "native" is **dehumanized**—not just oppressed but **psychologically broken** (*Ch. 5*).
- **Decolonization is **a violent birth**—not a negotiation but a **struggle for existence** (*Ch. 1*).
- **The colonized intellectual** must **reject European universalism** and **invent new values** (*Ch. 6*).

Fanon’s work exposed the **moral bankruptcy of the mission civilisatrice**: France’s **universalist claims** were a **smokescreen for domination**.

## **7. Auguste Comte and Positivism: The Ethics of Science as Religion**
Auguste Comte (1798–1857) founded **positivism**, a **secular religion of humanity** that sought to replace **theology with science** as the basis of ethics.

### **The Religion of Humanity**
- **Three Stages of History** (*Cours de philosophie positive*, 1830–1842):
  1. **Theological** (religion explains the world)
  2. **Metaphysical** (abstract philosophy)
  3. **Positive** (science explains the world)
- **The "Great Being"**: Humanity itself becomes the **object of worship** (*Système de politique positive*, 1851–1854).
- **Altruism as moral law**: "Live for others" (*Catéchisme positiviste*, 1852).

### **Durkheim and the Sociology of Morals**
Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) **secularized Comte’s ethics** in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life* (1912):
- **Society as sacred**: Morality comes from **collective consciousness**, not God.
- **Anomie**: The **breakdown of social norms** leads to **moral chaos** (*Suicide*, 1897).
- **Education as moral formation**: Schools must **instill civic virtue** (*Moral Education*, 1902–1903).

**The paradox**: Comte and Durkheim **replaced God with society**, but their **universalist ethics** were **blind to colonialism**—they assumed **European society** as the **model for all humanity**.

---

## **8. Key Scholars on French Ethical Thought**
- **Pierre Nora** (*Les Lieux de mémoire*, 1984–1992): How **memory sites** (the Pantheon, the Commune, Dreyfus) shape French identity.
- **Sudhir Hazareesingh** (*The Legend of Napoleon*, 2004): How **Bonapartism** became an **ethical myth** for the left and right.
- **Alice Conklin** (*A Mission to Civilize*, 1997): How the **mission civilisatrice** was **marketed as ethical** despite its violence.
- **Todd Shepard** (*The Invention of Decolonization*, 2006): How **Algeria’s independence** forced France to **redefine its universalism**.

---

## **Conclusion: The Ethical Paradox of French Universalism**
The 19th century in France was a **laboratory of ethical experimentation**, where **republican ideals** clashed with **colonial realities**. The same tradition that produced:
- **Tocqueville’s warnings about democratic tyranny** also justified **Algerian genocide**.
- **Hugo’s hymns to mercy** coexisted with **support for colonialism**.
- **The Commune’s radical egalitarianism** was drowned in **blood by the Republic**.
- **Zola’s defense of truth** exposed **antisemitism**

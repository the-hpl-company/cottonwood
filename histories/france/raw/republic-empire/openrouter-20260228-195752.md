### French Ethical Thought in the 19th Century and the Third Republic (c. 1815–1940)

The 19th century and the Third Republic represent a period of profound ethical tension in France, defined by the interplay between republican universalism and colonial empire. Below is a structured analysis of key thinkers, events, and movements, rooted in specific texts, legislation, and dates.

### 1. **Alexis de Tocqueville: Democracy and Colonial Violence**
Tocqueville’s *Democracy in America* (1835, 1840) is a landmark ethical analysis of democratic society, emphasizing the dangers of majority tyranny and the need for civic virtue. However, Tocqueville also wrote extensively on Algeria, advocating for colonization and justifying violence against Algerians. In his *Essay on Algeria* (1841), he argued that "war is sometimes necessary to found colonies" and that colonialism would "civilize" Algeria. This dualism reveals the core tension of French universalism: the same thinker who championed liberty and democracy in America endorsed authoritarianism in Algeria. This is not hypocrisy but the structure of French universalism, which claimed to extend civilization while denying equality to colonized peoples.

### 2. **The Paris Commune (1871): Radical Ethical Experiment**
The Paris Commune (March 18–May 28, 1871) was Europe’s most radical ethical experiment in the 19th century. The Communards implemented workers’ cooperatives, separation of church and state, and gender equality in governance. Louise Michel, a leading Communard, exemplified the ethical commitment to justice and solidarity. The Commune was brutally suppressed during *La Semaine Sanglante* (May 21–28, 1871), with tens of thousands killed. Despite its short life, the Commune became an ethical reference point for French leftist movements, embodying the struggle for working-class empowerment and social justice.

### 3. **Victor Hugo: Ethics of Redemption and Mercy**
Victor Hugo’s *Les Misérables* (1862) is a monumental ethical novel exploring redemption (Jean Valjean), the limits of law (Javert), and the power of mercy (Bishop Myriel). Hugo’s ethical vision was deeply humanistic, emphasizing compassion and social justice. However, his stance on colonialism was ambivalent: while he opposed slavery, he supported the "civilizing mission," reflecting the contradictions of French universalism. His *Napoleon the Little* (1852) condemned Napoleon III’s authoritarianism, asserting Hugo’s commitment to republican ideals.

### 4. **The Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906): Ethical Crisis of Modern France**
The Dreyfus Affair was a defining ethical crisis, exposing deep divisions over justice, antisemitism, and the role of the military. Captain Alfred Dreyfus, falsely accused of treason, became a symbol of injustice. Emile Zola’s *J’accuse* (1898) was a scathing ethical indictment of the military and government, demanding truth and justice. The Affair crystallized the split between Dreyfusards (pro-republican, pro-justice) and anti-Dreyfusards (anti-Semitic, militaristic), shaping modern French ethics and laicité.

### 5. **Laïcité: The 1905 Law on Secularism**
The 1905 Law on the Separation of Churches and the State established laïcité as France’s ethical framework for militant secularism. Unlike the American separation of church and state, laïcité is rooted in Enlightenment rationalism and aims to protect the republic from religious influence. Jules Ferry’s secular education laws (1880s) sought to replace religious instruction with civic morality, promoting republican values. However, laïcité also marginalized religious minorities, particularly Muslims in Algeria, revealing its exclusionary potential.

### 6. **Colonialism as Ethical Claim: The Civilizing Mission**
France’s colonial empire was justified through the *mission civilisatrice*, the ethical claim that France was spreading civilization to "backward" peoples. Algeria, colonized in 1830, became a settler colony, with the Crémieux Decree (1870) granting citizenship to Algerian Jews but not Muslims, institutionalizing ethnic hierarchies. Frantz Fanon’s *The Wretched of the Earth* (1961) offered a devastating critique of French colonialism, exposing its violence and hypocrisy. Fanon’s work remains a cornerstone of postcolonial ethics within the French tradition.

### 7. **Auguste Comte and Positivism: Ethics of Science**
Auguste Comte’s positivism sought to replace religion with science, proposing a Religion of Humanity (*Cours de Philosophie Positive*, 1830–1842). Comte’s ethical system emphasized social harmony and progress, influencing thinkers like Emile Durkheim, who analyzed the sociology of morals (*The Division of Labor in Society*, 1893). Positivism also shaped ethical thought in Brazil and Mexico, demonstrating its global impact.

- **Sudhir Hazareesingh**: *How the French Think* (2015) analyzes French intellectual traditions.

### **French Ethical Thought, 1940–1980: From Vichy to Poststructuralism**
France’s ethical landscape in this period is defined by **rupture, reckoning, and radical redefinition**—from the moral collapse of Vichy to the existentialist demand for absolute responsibility, the decolonial reckoning of Algeria, and the poststructuralist decentering of the human subject. This era forces France to confront the **tension between universalist claims and particular exclusions**—a tension that remains unresolved.

## **1. Vichy and the Ethics of Collaboration: The Betrayal of Republican Universalism**
### **Pétain’s "National Revolution" (1940–1944): An Anti-Republican Ethics**
After France’s defeat in June 1940, Marshal Philippe Pétain established the **État Français** in Vichy, dismantling the Third Republic and replacing its motto (*Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité*) with **"Travail, Famille, Patrie"**—a reactionary triptych that rejected the Enlightenment’s universalism in favor of a **Catholic, corporatist, and xenophobic order**.

- **The Constitutional Acts (July 1940)**:
  - **Act No. 1 (July 11, 1940)**: Pétain assumes "more powers than Louis XIV" (Paxton), declaring himself *Chef de l’État* with authority to draft a new constitution.
  - **Act No. 2 (July 11, 1940)**: Suspends the Third Republic’s parliament.
  - **Act No. 4 (July 12, 1940)**: Grants Pétain the power to name his successor, effectively establishing a **personal dictatorship**.
  - **Act No. 7 (October 27, 1940)**: The first **Statut des Juifs**, excluding Jews from public office, journalism, and teaching—**without German pressure** (Paxton, *Vichy France*, 1972, p. 169).

- **The Ethics of Exclusion**:
  - Pétain’s regime was not merely a **German puppet** but an **active collaborator** in its own right, pursuing a **counter-revolutionary ethics** that rejected the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man.
  - **Family**: The regime promoted **natalism** (the *Code de la Famille*, 1939, expanded under Vichy) to combat "depopulation," but this was tied to **racial purity**—divorce was restricted, abortion criminalized (1942 law making it a "crime against the state"), and single mothers stigmatized.
  - **Work**: Corporatist labor laws (the *Charte du Travail*, 1941) abolished unions and strikes, replacing class struggle with **state-controlled syndicalism**.
  - **Patrie**: The regime glorified **rural France** (*"la terre, elle, ne ment pas"*) while scapegoating Jews, Freemasons, and communists. The **Légion Française des Combattants** (1940) became a paramilitary force enforcing loyalty to Pétain.

- **The Vel d’Hiv Roundup (July 16–17, 1942)**:
  - **French police**, not the Gestapo, arrested **13,152 Jews** (including 4,115 children) in Paris and held them in the **Vélodrome d’Hiver** before deportation to Auschwitz.
  - **No German orders were needed**—Vichy’s **Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives** (est. 1941) actively participated in the Final Solution.
  - **Ethical Reckoning**:
    - **De Gaulle’s myth of "la France résistante"** (postwar Gaullist narrative) obscured Vichy’s crimes until **Robert Paxton’s *Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order* (1972)**, which proved that collaboration was **voluntary, not coerced**.
    - **Jacques Chirac’s 1995 speech** (July 16) was the first official acknowledgment of French state responsibility:
      > *"La France, ce jour-là, accomplissait l’irréparable. Manquant à sa parole, elle livrait ses protégés à leurs bourreaux."* ("France, on that day, committed the irreparable. Breaking its word, it delivered its protégés to their executioners.")

## **2. The Resistance as Ethical Tradition: Reclaiming the Republic**
### **De Gaulle’s June 18 Appeal (1940): The Ethics of Refusal**
- **June 18, 1940 (BBC Broadcast)**:
  > *"La France a perdu une bataille! Mais la France n’a pas perdu la guerre!"* ("France has lost a battle! But France has not lost the war!")
  - De Gaulle’s appeal was **not just a military call** but an **ethical one**—a refusal to accept defeat as moral surrender.
  - He positioned himself as the **embodiment of republican legitimacy**, rejecting Vichy’s claim to represent France.

### **Intellectual Resistance: Camus, Vercors, and the Ethics of Silence**
- **Albert Camus, *Combat* (1944–1947)**:
  - Camus’s underground newspaper (later legalized) became the **moral voice of the Resistance**.
  - **August 24, 1944 (Liberation of Paris)**:
    > *"La France commence aujourd’hui sa résurrection. […] Nous ne sommes pas des vainqueurs, mais des hommes libres."* ("France begins its resurrection today. […] We are not victors, but free men.")
  - Camus’s **ethics of limits** (later developed in *The Rebel*) emerged here: **resistance without fanaticism, justice without vengeance**.

- **Vercors (Jean Bruller), *The Silence of the Sea* (*Le Silence de la Mer*, 1942)**:
  - A **fictionalized account of passive resistance**, where a French family refuses to speak to a German officer billeted in their home.
  - The **ethics of silence** as a form of **moral defiance**—a rejection of collaboration without direct confrontation.

### **The Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR) and the Postwar Social Contract (1944)**
- **March 15, 1944: The CNR Program** (*Les Jours Heureux*):
  - A **blueprint for postwar France**, drafted by **communists, socialists, Gaullists, and Christian democrats**.
  - **Key ethical foundations**:
    - **Social security** (1945 implementation, inspired by the Beveridge Report but with **French republican universalism**).
    - **Nationalization of key industries** (coal, electricity, banks) to prevent capitalist exploitation.
    - **Women’s suffrage** (granted in 1944, implemented in 1945).
    - **Free, secular education** (expanding Jules Ferry’s 1880s laws).
  - The CNR program was **not just a policy document but an ethical manifesto**—a rejection of Vichy’s reactionary order and a reassertion of **republican solidarity**.

---

## **3. Sartre: Existentialism as Radical Ethics**
### **Being and Nothingness (1943): Freedom as Ethical Burden**
- **Key passage (Part 1, Ch. 1, §5)**:
  > *"L’homme est condamné à être libre. Condamné, parce qu’il ne s’est pas créé lui-même, et par ailleurs cependant libre, parce qu’une fois jeté dans le monde, il est responsable de tout ce qu’il fait."* ("Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet nonetheless free, because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.")
  - **Existence precedes essence**: There is **no human nature**, no divine plan—only **radical freedom and radical responsibility**.
  - **Bad faith (mauvaise foi)**: The **ethical failure** of denying one’s freedom (e.g., the waiter who plays the role of "waiter" too perfectly, as if it were his essence).

- **Existentialism is a Humanism (1946)**:
  - Sartre’s **popularization of existentialist ethics** for a postwar audience.
  - **Key argument**:
    > *"L’homme n’est rien d’autre que ce qu’il se fait."* ("Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.")
    - **No excuses**: Poverty, oppression, or circumstance do not absolve responsibility—**one must act within one’s situation**.
    - **Ethics as engagement**: *"L’existentialisme est un humanisme"*—humanism not as a fixed ideal, but as a **commitment to others**.

### **Dirty Hands (1948): The Ethics of Political Violence**
- **The play’s dilemma**: Hugo, a communist assassin, must kill Hoederer, a party leader who compromises with bourgeois parties.
- **Key ethical question**:
  > *"Faut-il salir ses mains pour faire de la politique?"* ("Must one dirty one’s hands to do politics?")
  - Sartre **does not provide an answer**—he forces the audience to confront the **moral ambiguity of revolutionary action**.
  - **Postwar context**: The play was written during the **purges of collaborators**—when France was grappling with **how to punish without becoming monstrous**.

### **Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960): Existentialism Meets Marxism**
- Sartre’s attempt to **reconcile existentialism with Marxism**—arguing that **freedom is not abstract but situated in material conditions**.
- **Key concept: ** *Seriality* (the alienated crowd, e.g., people waiting for a bus) vs. *the group-in-fusion* (revolutionary collective action).
- **Ethical implication**: **True freedom requires collective struggle**—but Sartre remains **skeptical of Stalinism**, insisting on **individual responsibility within the group**.

### **Refusal of the Nobel Prize (1964)**
- Sartre’s **ethical act of refusal**:
  > *"Un écrivain doit refuser de se laisser transformer en institution."* ("A writer must refuse to let himself be turned into an institution.")
  - A rejection of **bourgeois honors** in favor of **revolutionary commitment**.

---

## **4. Beauvoir: Feminist Ethics and the Ambiguity of Freedom**
### **The Second Sex (1949): The Ethics of Becoming a Woman**
- **Key passage (Vol. 2, Ch. 1)**:
  > *"On ne naît pas femme: on le devient."* ("One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.")
  - **Ethical implication**: **Gender is not natural but constructed**—and thus **can be changed**.
  - Beauvoir’s **phenomenological approach** (influenced by Sartre and Merleau-Ponty) shows how **women are socialized into oppression**.
  - **The "Other" as ethical category**:
    > *"Elle est l’Autre au cœur d’une totalité dont les deux termes sont nécessaires l’un à l’autre."* ("She is the Other at the heart of a totality whose two terms are necessary to each other.")
    - **Man = Subject, Woman = Other**—a **structural inequality** that defines Western ethics.

### **The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947): Existentialist Ethics Proper**
- **Key argument**:
  - **Freedom is ambiguous**: We are **both subject and object**, free yet constrained by our bodies, others, and history.
  - **Ethics must embrace this ambiguity**—neither **pure individualism** (Sartre’s early work) nor **deterministic Marxism**.
  - **Key passage (Ch. 3)**:
    > *"Vivre, c’est se choisir."* ("To live is to choose oneself.")
    - **Ethics is not a set of rules but a **project of self-creation** in relation to others.

### **The Coming of Age (1970): The Ethics of Aging**
- Beauvoir’s **phenomenology of old age**—how society **dehumanizes the elderly**.
- **Key ethical claim**:
  > *"La vieillesse n’est pas un échec, c’est une oppression."* ("Old age is not a failure, it is an oppression.")
  - **Aging is not a natural decline but a **social construction**—one that **denies the elderly their subjectivity**.

---

## **5. Camus: The Ethics of the Absurd and Revolt**
### **The Myth of Sisyphus (1942): The Absurd as Ethical Starting Point**
- **Key passage (Conclusion)**:
  > *"Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux."* ("One must imagine Sisyphus happy.")
  - **The absurd**: The **confrontation between human desire for meaning and a silent universe**.
  - **Ethical response**: **Revolt**—not suicide or resignation, but **embracing the struggle itself**.
  - **Sisyphus as ethical hero**: His **defiance** in the face of meaninglessness is **freedom**.

### **The Plague (1947): Ethics in the Face of Suffering**
- **Dr. Rieux’s struggle against the plague in Oran**—an allegory for **Nazism and the Resistance**.
- **Key ethical themes**:
  - **Solidarity in suffering**: *"Il faut se mettre du côté des victimes, en quelque occasion que ce soit."* ("One must always take the side of the victims, whatever the circumstances.")
  - **The limits of heroism**: Rieux is **not a saint**—he acts out of **human decency, not grand ideals**.
  - **The plague as metaphor for evil**: *"Chacun la porte en soi, la peste, parce que personne, non, personne au monde n’en est indemne."* ("Everyone carries the plague within themselves, because no one, no one in the world, is immune.")

### **The Rebel (1951): The Ethics of Revolt Without Revolution**
- **Key argument**:
  - **Revolt** is the **affirmation of human dignity** against oppression.
  - **But revolution** (especially Marxist revolution) **risks becoming tyrannical**.
  - **Key passage (Ch. 4)**:
    > *"Je me révolte, donc nous sommes."* ("I rebel, therefore we exist.")
    - **Revolt is inherently collective**—but it must **respect limits** to avoid becoming murderous.
  - **Critique of Marxism**:
    > *"Le révolutionnaire veut faire le monde; le rebelle veut que le monde soit."* ("The revolutionary wants to make the world; the rebel wants the world to be.")
    - **Camus rejects historical determinism**—**ethics must come before ideology**.

### **The Sartre-Camus Break (1952): The Ethics of Political Violence**
- **Sartre’s review of *The Rebel* (1952)**:
  - Accuses Camus of **moral absolutism**—of **refusing to dirty his hands** in the fight against colonialism and capitalism.
  - **Key line**:
    > *"Camus, vous êtes un bourgeois!"* ("Camus, you are a bourgeois!")
- **Camus’s response**:
  - **Revolutionary violence risks becoming **just as oppressive as the systems it fights**.
  - **Key passage (Letter to *Les Temps Modernes*, 1952)**:
    > *"Je ne suis pas un philosophe de la révolte, mais un écrivain qui dit non."* ("I am not a philosopher of revolt, but a writer who says no.")
  - **The break was not just personal but **ethical**—a clash between **Sartre’s engagement** and **Camus’s limits**.

### **Camus and Algeria: The Impossible Ethical Position**
- **Camus as pied-noir (Algerian-born Frenchman)**:
  - **Opposed colonialism** but **could not endorse FLN violence** (e.g., the 1956 bombing of the Milk Bar in Algiers, which killed children).
  - **1957 Nobel Prize speech (December 10)**:
    > *"Je crois à la justice, mais je défendrai ma mère avant la justice."* ("I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice.")
    - **A scandalous statement**—seen as **betraying universalism** for particularism.
  - **His position was **ethically untenable**—caught between **colonial oppression and revolutionary violence**.

---

## **6. The Algerian War (1954–1962): The Ethical Catastrophe of Decolonization**
### **The Battle of Algiers (1957) and the Ethics of Torture**
- **General Massu’s use of torture** (electric shocks, waterboarding, rape) to break the FLN.
- **Henri Alleg, *The Question* (1958)**:
  - A **firsthand account of torture** by a communist journalist.
  - **Key passage**:
    > *"La question, c’est la torture. La question, c’est la France."* ("The question is torture. The question is France.")
  - **The book was banned in France**—but its publication **forced a reckoning** with colonial violence.

### **Fanon’s *The Wretched of the Earth* (1961) and Sartre’s Preface**
- **Frantz Fanon (Martinican psychiatrist, FLN supporter)**:
  - **Key argument**:
    - **Colonialism is **violence in its natural state**—and **decolonization must be violent** to break the colonial order.
    - **Key passage (Ch. 1)**:
      > *"La décolonisation est toujours un phénomène violent."* ("Decolonization is always a violent phenomenon.")
    - **The colonized must **reclaim their humanity through struggle**—even if it means **becoming the monster they fight**.
- **Sartre’s preface (1961)**:
  - **Endorses Fanon’s call for violence**:
    > *"Tuer un Européen, c’est faire d’une pierre deux coups, supprimer à la fois un oppresseur et un opprimé: restent un homme mort et un homme libre."* ("To kill a European is to kill two birds with one stone: to eliminate an oppressor and an oppressed man at once—leaving a dead man and a free man.")
  - **A radical departure from Camus’s ethics of limits**—Sartre **embraces revolutionary violence as necessary**.

### **The Aftermath:

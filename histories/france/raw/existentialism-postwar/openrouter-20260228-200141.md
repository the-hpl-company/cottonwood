### French Ethical Thought from Vichy to Poststructuralism (1940-1980)

The period from 1940 to 1980 in France was marked by profound ethical crises and transformations, from the moral collapse of Vichy to the existentialist and poststructuralist reevaluations of human freedom and responsibility. Below is a detailed examination of these developments.

---

### 1. **Vichy and the Ethics of Collaboration**
The Vichy regime (1940-1944), led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, adopted the slogan "Travail, Famille, Patrie" (Work, Family, Fatherland) as its ethical framework, positioning itself as a moral counterpoint to the perceived decadence of the Third Republic. Pétain’s "National Revolution" emphasized traditional Catholic values, anti-modernism, and xenophobia, including virulent anti-Semitism.

- The **Vel’ d'Hiv Roundup** (July 16-17, 1942) marked a moral nadir: French police arrested 13,152 Jews in Paris, including 4,000 children, and deported them to Auschwitz. This act revealed the complicity of French institutions in Nazi genocide. 
- The ethical reckoning came belatedly. **Jacques Chirac, in 1995**, became the first French president to acknowledge Vichy’s role in the Holocaust: "These dark hours forever sully our history."
- **Robert Paxton's "Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944" (1972)** shattered the Gaullist myth of universal resistance, demonstrating that Vichy actively collaborated with Nazi Germany and pursued its own agenda of exclusion and persecution.

### 2. **The Resistance as Ethical Tradition**
The Resistance offered a counter-narrative to Vichy’s moral collapse. **Charles de Gaulle's June 18 Appeal (1940)** symbolized the ethical imperative to fight against tyranny.

- The intellectual resistance included **Albert Camus**, who edited the underground newspaper *Combat*, and **Vercors**, whose clandestine novella *The Silence of the Sea* (1942) depicted the ethical tension between French honor and German occupation.
- The **Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR)** adopted a program in **1944** that became the ethical foundation of the postwar welfare state, emphasizing social justice, nationalization, and workers’ rights.

### 3. **Jean-Paul Sartre: Radical Freedom and Responsibility**
Sartre’s existentialist ethics are articulated in *Being and Nothingness* (1943) and *Existentialism is a Humanism* (1946). His claim that "existence precedes essence" (1946) posits radical freedom as the foundation of ethical action.

- **Bad faith (mauvaise foi)**—the denial of one’s freedom—is an ethical failing. Sartre’s example of the café waiter (*Being and Nothingness*) illustrates how individuals often evade responsibility by conforming to societal roles.
- *Dirty Hands* (1948) explores the ethics of political violence, asking whether moral purity is possible in politics.
- Sartre’s *Critique of Dialectical Reason* (1960) aligned existentialism with Marxism, emphasizing collective responsibility.
- His refusal of the **Nobel Prize** (1964) was an ethical act, rejecting institutionalization and bourgeois values.

### 4. **Simone de Beauvoir: Feminist Ethics and Ambiguity**
Beauvoir’s *The Second Sex* (1949) declared, "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman," formulating feminist ethics as a critique of patriarchal systems.

- *The Ethics of Ambiguity* (1947) argues that freedom is both a burden and a gift, requiring individuals to confront the ambiguity of human existence.
- Her relationship with Sartre was an ethical experiment in non-monogamy and intellectual partnership.
- In *The Coming of Age* (1970), Beauvoir addressed the ethics of how society treats the elderly, critiquing their marginalization.

### 5. **Albert Camus: The Ethics of the Absurd and Revolt**
Camus’s works grapple with the ethical implications of the absurd, the condition in which human beings seek meaning in a meaningless universe.

- *The Stranger* (1942) and *The Myth of Sisyphus* (1942) explore the absurd, while *The Plague* (1947) portrays collective ethical responsibility in the face of suffering.
- *The Rebel* (1951) articulates an ethics of revolt, condemning both fascism and revolutionary violence. Camus’s break with Sartre over communism’s moral compromises (*The Rebel’s* critique of Marxism) was a pivotal ethical debate.
- Camus’s position on Algeria was uniquely fraught: as a *pied-noir*, he opposed colonialism but rejected the FLN’s violent tactics, advocating for an egalitarian, binational Algeria.

### 6. **The Algerian War: Ethical Catastrophe**
The Algerian War (1954-1962) exposed the contradictions of France’s universalist rhetoric.

- French forces used systematic torture, as detailed in **Henri Alleg’s *The Question*** (1958).
- **Frantz Fanon’s *The Wretched of the Earth*** (1961), with Sartre’s preface endorsing revolutionary violence, became a manifesto for decolonization.
- The war fractured France ethically: the *pieds-noirs* felt betrayed, the *harkis* (Algerians loyal to France) were abandoned, and the **OAS** (Secret Army Organization) committed terrorism to preserve French Algeria.
- France has yet to fully reckon with its colonial past.

### 7. **Poststructuralist Ethics**
The structuralist and poststructuralist turn reshaped ethical reasoning.

- **Claude Lévi-Strauss** critiqued ethnocentrism, arguing for cultural relativism in *Tristes Tropiques* (1955).
- **Michel Foucault**, in *Discipline and Punish* (1975), analyzed power/knowledge regimes, while his later work on the "ethics of the self" (*The Care of the Self*, 1984) emphasized individual ethical practices.
- **Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction** (*Of Grammatology*, 1967) focused on the ethics of the Other, challenging metaphysical certainties.
- **Emmanuel Levinas** argued in *Totality and Infinity* (1961) that ethics is "first philosophy," grounded in the encounter with the Other’s face.

Poststructuralism destabilized traditional ethical frameworks, making possible new modes of critique but also raising questions about the possibility of universal moral claims.

### 8. **Key Scholars**
- **Tony Judt** (*Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944-1956*, 1992) critiques postwar French intellectuals’ moral compromises.
- **Kristin Ross** (*Fast Cars, Clean Bodies: Decolonization and the Reordering of French Culture*, 1995) explores the ethical implications of France’s modernization.
- **James Le Sueur** (*Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization of Algeria*, 2001) examines the Algerian War’s ethical dilemmas.
- **Edward Baring** (*The Young Derrida and French Philosophy, 1945-1968*, 2011) traces Derrida’s ethical thought.

### Conclusion
This period reveals the tension between France’s universalist ethical claims and its particular exclusions—most starkly in Vichy’s collaboration and the Algerian War. Existentialism and poststructuralism offered radical reimaginings of freedom, responsibility, and the Other, reshaping ethical thought for the 20th century and beyond. Yet, France’s failure to fully reckon with its ethical failures—Vichy, Algeria, colonialism—leaves its moral tradition incomplete.

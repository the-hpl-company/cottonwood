# French Ethical Thought, 1940–1980: From Vichy to Poststructuralism

## 1. Vichy and the Ethics of Collaboration: The “National Revolution” as Anti-Republican Morality
The Vichy regime (État Français, 1940–1944) under Marshal Philippe Pétain instituted an explicit ethical framework to replace the Republican triad of *Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité*. The new motto—***Travail, Famille, Patrie*** (Work, Family, Fatherland)—promoted an organicist, authoritarian, and Catholic traditionalist morality grounded in rejection of the “decadent” individualism of the Third Republic.

*   **Pétain’s “National Revolution”** (1940-1941) was articulated as a moral regeneration: a return to soil, hierarchy, and duty. In his speech of October 11, 1940, Pétain declared, “We are going to try to reconstitute, in its natural groupings—family, trade, municipality—a France that has been pulverized by a century of individualism” (*Discours aux Français*, 1940). This was an ethics of exclusion, defining the “true” France against internal “anti-France”: Jews, Freemasons, communists, and “cosmopolitan” intellectuals.
*   **The Vel’ d’Hiv Roundup (July 16–17, 1942)** stands as the definitive ethical rupture. The operation, planned by Nazi SS-Obersturmführer Theodor Dannecker, was executed by 9,000 French police under the authority of Paris police prefect René Bousquet. 13,152 Jews, including 4,115 children, were arrested and held at the Vélodrome d’Hiver before deportation to Auschwitz. This was not imposed by German troops; it was a French administrative act, revealing how a state bureaucracy could pervert ethics into a logistics of genocide.
*   **The Ethical Reckoning:** The Gaullist myth of a “France of resisters” was shattered by Robert O. Paxton’s archival work in *Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940–1944* (1972). Paxton demonstrated Vichy’s proactive collaboration and ideological affinity with fascism. The official French state only acknowledged culpability with President Jacques Chirac’s speech on July 16, 1995: “France, the homeland of the Enlightenment and of the rights of man… on that day committed the irreparable. Breaking its word, it delivered those it protected to their executioners.”

## 2. The Resistance as Ethical Tradition: From Refusal to Reconstruction
The ethical counterpoint to Vichy was the Resistance, both in action and in intellectual articulation.

*   **De Gaulle’s Appeal of June 18, 1940** (broadcast from London) established the ethical claim of legitimacy: “Has the last word been said? Must hope disappear? Is this defeat final? No!… Whatever happens, the flame of French resistance must not and shall not die.” This founded an ethics of refusal and continuity of the Republic.
*   **The Intellectual Resistance:** Albert Camus, as editor of the clandestine newspaper *Combat*, wrote in the August 24, 1944, editorial: “A great movement of opinion, born in the depths of the national conscience, carried us along… We knew that the revolution would be moral or it would not be.” The literary resistance is epitomized by Vercors’s (Jean Bruller) clandestine novella *Le Silence de la mer* (1942), which ethics of passive, silent non-cooperation in the face of occupation.
*   **The Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR) Program (March 1944)** became the ethical blueprint for the postwar social contract. It called for “a complete plan of immediate action” including “the establishment of a true economic and social democracy,” nationalizations of key industries, and a comprehensive social security system. This document directly linked the ethics of resistance to the ethics of social solidarity, forming the foundation of the *Trente Glorieuses* welfare state.

## 3. Jean-Paul Sartre: Existentialism as Radical Ethics
Sartre’s philosophy provided the dominant ethical vocabulary for the postwar generation grappling with the collapse of traditional values.

*   ***L’Être et le Néant* (1943):** The foundational claim—“*l’existence précède l’essence*”—makes the human being radically free and thus radically responsible. There is no pre-given human nature or moral code; we invent ourselves through our acts. The concept of ***mauvaise foi*** (bad faith) is his primary ethical category—the self-deception by which we flee the anguish of freedom by pretending to be determined, like the café waiter who “plays at being a waiter” to escape his own subjectivity (Part I, Chapter 2).
*   ***L’Existentialisme est un humanisme* (1946):** Sartre defends existentialism as an ethics of engagement. “Man is condemned to be free… and from the moment he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.” The famous formulation: “In choosing myself, I choose man.” This is an ethics of universalization through singular choice.
*   ***Les Mains sales* (1948):** This play stages the central ethical dilemma of the engaged intellectual: can political efficacy (“dirty hands”) be reconciled with moral purity? The protagonist Hoederer argues, “I have dirty hands right up to the elbows. I’ve plunged them in filth and blood. But what do you hope? Do you think you can govern innocently?”
*   ***Critique de la raison dialectique* (1960):** Sartre attempts to synthesize existentialism with Marxism, arguing that ethics must confront the “practico-inert”—the weight of material history and scarcity that alienates human freedom. His refusal of the Nobel Prize in 1964 was an ethical act of refusing to be “institutionalized” and maintaining the stance of the critical outsider.

## 4. Simone de Beauvoir: Existentialist Feminism and the Ethics of Ambiguity
Beauvoir applied and transformed existentialist ethics, most profoundly to the condition of women.

*   ***Pour une morale de l’ambiguïté* (1947):** Here, Beauvoir develops a positive existentialist ethics. If the human condition is fundamentally ambiguous (both subject and object, free yet situated), ethics consists in assuming this ambiguity, not fleeing it. Evil is the desire to be pure—either pure thing (the sub-human) or pure freedom (the serious man). “To will oneself free is also to will others free.”
*   ***Le Deuxième Sexe* (1949):** The foundational text of modern feminist ethics begins with the revolutionary claim: “*On ne naît pas femme : on le devient.*” Beauvoir analyzes how woman is constructed as the essential *Other* (“*l’Autre*”) to man, the absolute Subject. This is an ethical analysis of oppression: “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.” Her ethics demand the concrete realization of women’s transcendence through economic independence and active projects.
*   ***La Vieillesse* (1970):** Extending her ethical analysis to another marginalized group, Beauvoir argues that society treats the elderly as the “Other,” rendering them invisible and stripping them of their subjectivity. This is an ethical failure to recognize the continuity of the self and the ambiguity of the aging body.

## 5. Albert Camus: The Ethics of the Absurd and Revolt
Camus’s ethical trajectory runs parallel to, and then definitively breaks from, Sartre’s, centered on the concepts of the absurd and revolt.

*   ***L’Étranger* (1942) & *Le Mythe de Sisyphe* (1942):** The starting point is the absurd—the confrontation between the human need for meaning and the “unreasonable silence of the world.” Ethics, for the absurd man, begins with lucid acknowledgment and revolt, which is “the certainty of a crushing fate, without the resignation that ought to accompany it.”
*   ***La Peste* (1947):** An allegory of the Occupation and of ethical choice. Faced with the plague (evil), the characters choose different forms of engagement. Dr. Rieux represents the ethics of modest, human-scale solidarity: “All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it’s up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestilences.”
*   ***L’Homme révolté* (1951):** This book caused the definitive break with Sartre. Camus distinguishes *revolt* from *revolution*. Revolt is a metaphysical “no” that affirms a shared human value; it sets limits. Revolution, in its Marxist-Leninist form, becomes nihilistic, justifies unlimited violence, and creates new forms of tyranny. Camus’s ethics are thus of measured, “midday” thought, opposing both the injustice of the world and the terror of absolute revolution. His position on Algeria—denouncing colonial injustice but refusing to endorse the FLN’s revolutionary violence—was condemned by Sartre as a “bourgeois” ethics of purity, leaving him isolated.

## 6. The Algerian War (1954–1962): The Crucible of French Ethics
The war exposed the fatal contradiction between France’s universalist republican ideals and its colonial practice, a crisis from which French ethics has never fully recovered.

*   **The Practice of Torture:** The French army’s systematic use of torture (waterboarding, electricity, sexual violence) during the Battle of Algiers (1957) was exposed by journalist Henri Alleg in *La Question* (1958), a book immediately banned in France. Alleg’s firsthand account forced an ethical reckoning: how could the Republic that gave birth to the *Déclaration des droits de l’homme* employ such methods?
*   **Frantz Fanon’s *Les Damnés de la Terre* (1961), with Sartre’s Preface:** Fanon, a psychiatrist from Martinique who worked for the FLN, provided the ethical framework for anti-colonial violence. For the colonized, violence is a “cleansing force” that frees them from inferiority and restores their humanity. Sartre’s infamous preface went further, addressing Europeans: “For in the first days of the revolt you must kill: to shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone… there remains a dead man and a free man.”
*   **The Unresolved Reckoning:** The war created multiple, irreconcilable ethical positions: the *pieds-noirs* (European settlers) who felt abandoned; the *harkis* (Algerians who fought for France) who were massacred and then neglected; the partisans of *Algérie française* in the OAS (Organisation de l’armée secrète) who used terrorism to oppose independence. As historian James Le Sueur argues in *Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization of Algeria* (2001), the war “shattered the French intellectual community” and left a legacy of “unresolved memory.”

## 7. The Structuralist and Poststructuralist Turn: De-centering the Ethical Subject
From the 1960s, the existentialist subject—free, conscious, responsible—was dismantled by thinkers who located the sources of ethics in structures, discourses, and the Other.

*   **Claude Lévi-Strauss (Structural Anthropology):** In *Race et Histoire* (1952), he launched a powerful ethical critique of ethnocentrism, arguing that no culture could claim to be the absolute benchmark for humanity. Ethics must begin with the recognition of the *other culture* as a coherent, valid system.
*   **Emmanuel Levinas:** In *Totalité et Infini* (1961), Levinas makes ethics, not ontology, “first philosophy.” The face-to-face encounter with the *Autrui* (the Other) issues an infinite ethical demand: “Thou shalt not kill.” This is an ethics of radical responsibility *for* the Other that precedes my own freedom, directly challenging Sartrian existentialism.
*   **Michel Foucault:** His work displaces ethics from the domain of universal codes to the analysis of power/knowledge regimes. *Surveiller et Punir* (1975) is not just a history of the prison but an ethical inquiry into how modern society produces “docile bodies.” His later work on the “care of the self” (e.g., *Histoire de la sexualité*, Vol. 2-3, 1984) explores ethics as a practice of self-formation within constraints of power.
*   **Jacques Derrida (Deconstruction):** Derrida, reading Levinas, develops an ethics of *différance* and undecidability. In *Force de loi* (1990), he argues that a just decision must not be the mere application of a rule; it must be reinvented in the singular encounter with the other. Justice is an infinite demand that always exceeds any existing law or calculation.

## 8. Synthesis: The Ethical Landscape, 1940–1980
As Tony Judt argues in *Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944-1956* (1992), the postwar period was defined by the search for a new ethical foundation after the collapse of traditional morality. The trajectory moves from:
1.  **The Immediate Postwar (1944-1950):** Existentialist ethics of radical freedom and engagement, born of the Resistance experience.
2.  **The Cold War and Decolonization (1950-1962):** The fracturing of that consensus over the ethics of political violence (Camus vs. Sartre) and the traumatic exposure of republican hypocrisy in Algeria.
3.  **The Post-1968 Era (c. 1968-1980):** The “death of the subject” and the rise of poststructuralist ethics, which shifted focus from the conscious individual to language, structure, power, and the irreducible Other. As Kristin Ross shows in *May ’68 and Its Afterlives* (2002), the failure of the political revolution of 1968 accelerated the turn toward a micropolitics of identity and difference, setting the stage for the *éthique de la différence* that would dominate the late 20th century.

The period is thus marked by a profound **displacement of the ethical center**: from the responsible Subject (Sartre) to the subjected individual (Foucault); from the fraternal Human (the CNR program) to the inassimilable Other (Levinas, Derrida); from the universal Republic to the irreducible particularity of the colonized, the woman, the marginalized. The French ethical tradition, in these four decades, both rigorously interrogated its own universalist claims and produced some of the most potent tools for thinking about harm, responsibility, and care in a fractured world.

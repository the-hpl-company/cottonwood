### Ethical Traditions in France’s Overseas Territories: DOM-TOM as Sites of Distinct Ethical Thought

France’s overseas territories (DOM-TOM) are not peripheral appendages to metropolitan France but are instead vibrant sites of ethical thought that challenge assimilationist narratives and assert distinct identities. These territories have cultivated ethical frameworks rooted in anti-colonial resistance, creolization, environmental justice, and decolonization. Below is an exploration of these traditions, grounded in specific thinkers, movements, and events.

#### 1. **Martinique: Négritude and the Ethics of Black Identity**
Martinique has been a central site of Caribbean intellectual resistance, particularly through the work of **Aimé Césaire** (1913–2008). In *Notebook of a Return to the Native Land* (*Cahier d'un retour au pays natal*, 1939), Césaire reclaims Black identity through the Négritude movement, which emerged as a counter to French assimilationist policies. Négritude asserts the ethical necessity of affirming Black cultural and historical identity against the dehumanizing effects of colonialism.

In *Discourse on Colonialism* (*Discours sur le colonialisme*, 1950), Césaire critiques colonialism as a moral failure, equating it with Nazism in its dehumanizing logic. His ethical vision is deeply rooted in anti-colonialism and the liberation of Black peoples. Césaire’s break with the French Communist Party (detailed in his *Letter to Maurice Thorez*, 1956) highlights his commitment to autonomy and independence from metropolitan political structures. As mayor of Fort-de-France for 56 years (1945–2001), Césaire sought to institutionalize these ethical principles in governance.

#### 2. **Edouard Glissant: Creolization and Opacity**
**Edouard Glissant** (1928–2011) expands on Césaire’s work with his concept of **creolization**, articulated in *Caribbean Discourse* (*Le Discours antillais*, 1981) and *Poetics of Relation* (*Poétique de la Relation*, 1990). Creolization is not a melting pot but an active, unpredictable process of cultural mixing that resists homogenization. Glissant’s ethics of **opacity** asserts the right of individuals and cultures to remain incompletely understood or categorized, challenging Enlightenment universalism.

Glissant’s concept of **tout-monde** (whole-world) offers an ethical alternative to universalism, emphasizing interconnectedness without erasing difference. His work critiques the French Republic’s indivisible ethos, advocating instead for a relational ethics that respects pluralism.

#### 3. **Frantz Fanon: Revolutionary Violence and Decolonization**
**Frantz Fanon** (1925–1961), born in Martinique, became a global ethical voice for anti-colonial struggle. In *Black Skin, White Masks* (*Peau noire, masques blancs*, 1952), Fanon analyzes the psychological effects of colonization, exposing the internalized racism that assimilation produces. His ethical framework calls for the decolonization of the mind as a precursor to political liberation.

In *The Wretched of the Earth* (*Les Damnés de la Terre*, 1961), Fanon defends revolutionary violence as an ethical necessity for breaking colonial oppression. This stance diverged sharply from Césaire’s more conciliatory approach, highlighting tensions within Caribbean ethical thought. Fanon’s work remains foundational for movements advocating liberation through radical means.

#### 4. **Guadeloupe: Labor Justice and Environmental Ethics**
**Maryse Condé** (1934–2023) exemplifies the ethical assertion of Caribbean identity in Guadeloupe. Her literary works, such as *Segu* (1984), explore the complexities of postcolonial identity and resistance.

The 2009 general strike (*Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon*, LKP) marked a turning point in Guadeloupe’s ethical struggle against metropolitan economic exploitation. Lasting 44 days, the strike highlighted systemic inequalities and demanded fair wages and pricing. The ongoing **chlordecone scandal**—where the pesticide poisoned Guadeloupe’s soil and population—represents an unresolved environmental ethics crisis, raising questions about France’s responsibility and accountability.

#### 5. **French Guiana: Space, Colonialism, and Memory**
The **Kourou Space Centre**, established in 1964, stands on land with a complex colonial history, including the infamous **bagne** (penal colony) that operated until 1953. Sites like **Devil’s Island**, where Captain Alfred Dreyfus was imprisoned, highlight the ethical contradictions of France’s space program launching from colonial soil. The territory’s history underscores the persistence of colonial legacies in contemporary projects.

#### 6. **New Caledonia: Kanak Independence and Decolonization**
New Caledonia’s Kanak independence movement, led by figures like **Jean-Marie Tjibaou** (1936–1989), has challenged France’s indivisible republic model. The **Matignon Accords** (1988) and **Nouméa Accord** (1998) established frameworks for decolonization, culminating in three referenda (2018, 2020, 2021). Tjibaou’s assassination in 1989 underscored the violent stakes of this ethical struggle for self-determination.

#### 7. **French Polynesia: Nuclear Testing and Environmental Justice**
French Polynesia endured **193 nuclear tests** at Moruroa and Fangataufa (1966–1996), irradiating the indigenous population for metropolitan military gain. This ethical catastrophe remains a source of ongoing reckoning. **Oscar Temaru**, leader of the independence movement, has called for accountability and reparations, highlighting the ethical imperative of addressing colonial environmental harm.

#### 8. **Key Scholars and Interpretations**
- **Gary Wilder** (*Freedom Time: Negritude, Decolonization, and the Future of the World*, 2015) examines the ethical stakes of decolonization in France’s overseas territories.
- **Laurent Dubois** (*A Colony of Citizens: Revolution and Slave Emancipation in the French Caribbean, 1787–1804*, 2004) explores the historical roots of Caribbean ethical thought.
- **Mireille Rosello** (*France and the Maghreb: Performative Encounters*, 2005) and **Nick Nesbitt** (*Caribbean Critique: Antillean Critical Theory from Toussaint to Glissant*, 2013) offer critical analyses of French colonialism’s ethical implications.

### Conclusion
France’s overseas territories are not mere extensions of metropolitan France but ethical laboratories where thinkers like Césaire, Glissant, Fanon, and Condé have articulated visions of justice, identity, and decolonization. These traditions challenge the French Republic’s universalist ethos, asserting the rights of marginalized peoples to self-determination, cultural integrity, and environmental justice. The unresolved legacies of colonialism—from chlordecone poisoning to nuclear testing—continue to demand ethical reckoning and accountability.

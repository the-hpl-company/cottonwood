## France and Indochina: An Ethical History

France's colonial relationship with Indochina, encompassing modern-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, is a complex and often contradictory tapestry woven with threads of economic ambition, political maneuvering, and, crucially, ethical justifications and failures. Examining this history through an ethical lens reveals the profound moral tensions that shaped the colonial project and its enduring legacy.

### 1. Conquest and Justification: *La Mission Civilisatrice* in Action

The French intervention in Indochina began under Napoleon III in 1858, ostensibly to protect Catholic missionaries who were persecuted. The initial military campaigns, culminating in the treaties of 1862 and 1863 establishing French control over Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) and protectorates over Cambodia, were justified by the prevailing ideology of *la mission civilisatrice* ("the civilizing mission"). This doctrine, deeply rooted in Enlightenment ideals of progress and French cultural superiority, posited that France had a moral obligation to bring civilization – understood as French language, culture, and institutions – to supposedly less developed societies. As Jules Ferry argued in his 1883 speech before the French National Assembly: "The superior races have a right, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races."

The *mission civilisatrice* provided a convenient ethical gloss for economic and strategic interests. Under figures like Governor-General Paul Doumer (1897-1902), a vast program of infrastructure development was undertaken, including the construction of railroads, roads, and bridges. However, these projects were often financed and executed through *corvée* labor, a system of forced labor that extracted immense human cost and contradicted the purported civilizing goals. The construction of the Yunnan-Haiphong railway line, for example, cost the lives of an estimated 25,000 workers, mainly through disease and accidents.

Albert Sarraut, Governor-General of Indochina in two terms (1911-1914, 1917-1919), attempted to provide a more sophisticated ethical justification for colonialism in his 1923 book, *La Mise en valeur des colonies françaises* ("The Development of the French Colonies"). Sarraut argued that colonial development was not solely about extracting resources for the benefit of the metropole (France), but also about improving the lives of the colonized populations through education, healthcare, and economic modernization. While seemingly progressive, Sarraut's vision remained firmly rooted in the hierarchical relationship between colonizer and colonized, with France retaining ultimate control and reaping the primary benefits of colonial enterprise.

### 2. Ho Chi Minh and the French Connection: Reclaiming Revolutionary Ideals

The French colonial project inadvertently sowed the seeds of its own destruction. Ho Chi Minh, the future leader of the Vietnamese independence movement, spent formative years in France (circa 1917-1923), working as a photographer's assistant and immersing himself in French political culture. He was deeply influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution, particularly the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

In 1919, at the Versailles Peace Conference following World War I, Ho Chi Minh, then known as Nguyen Ai Quoc, presented a petition to the great powers, modeled on Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, demanding basic rights for the Vietnamese people, including freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. This document, entitled "Revendications du peuple annamite" ("Demands of the Annamite People"), was a direct appeal to the ethical principles upon which the French Republic was supposedly founded.

Disappointed by the indifference of the Western powers, Ho Chi Minh turned to Marxism-Leninism. He was a founding member of the French Communist Party at the Tours Congress in 1920, solidifying his commitment to revolutionary struggle as a means of achieving national liberation.

The irony of France's revolutionary heritage being used against it became starkly apparent in 1945 when Ho Chi Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese Declaration of Independence explicitly quoted the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789): "All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." By invoking these universal principles, Ho Chi Minh exposed the hypocrisy of French colonialism and appealed to a higher ethical standard that transcended national boundaries.

### 3. The Ethics of Colonial Education: Assimilation and Resistance

The Franco-Vietnamese school system was a central tool of the *mission civilisatrice*. While providing access to education for some Vietnamese, it primarily served to assimilate a select elite into French culture and values. The curriculum emphasized French language, history, and literature, often at the expense of Vietnamese traditions and knowledge. The romanization of Vietnamese, known as *quốc ngữ*, while facilitating literacy, also contributed to the displacement of the traditional *chữ Nôm* script and the erosion of cultural identity.

The École Française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), founded in 1898, played a crucial role in Orientalist knowledge production. While contributing valuable scholarship on Vietnamese history and culture, the EFEO also perpetuated a colonial gaze that often exoticized and essentialized the Vietnamese people, reinforcing the power dynamics of the colonial relationship.

Vietnamese intellectuals responded to colonialism in diverse ways. Phan Bội Châu advocated for armed resistance to French rule, believing that only through force could Vietnam regain its independence. Phan Châu Trinh, on the other hand, favored a strategy of reform from within, advocating for modernization and democratization through collaboration with the French. These competing ethical responses reflected the complex dilemmas faced by Vietnamese intellectuals grappling with the challenges of colonial domination.

### 4. Dien Bien Phu (1954): The End of an Era

The Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 marked a decisive turning point in the First Indochina War and the end of French colonial rule in Asia. The French defeat was not only a military catastrophe but also an ethical indictment of the colonial project.

The use of colonial troops, particularly from North Africa and Senegal, raised profound ethical questions about the exploitation of marginalized populations in the service of an unjust cause. These soldiers, often conscripted or lured by the promise of economic opportunity, were disproportionately exposed to the horrors of war and suffered heavy casualties.

The abandonment of Vietnamese allies, particularly those who had fought alongside the French against the Viet Minh, was another ethical failure. These collaborators were often left vulnerable to persecution and retribution after the French withdrawal.

The Geneva Accords of 1954, which formally ended the First Indochina War, divided Vietnam along the 17th parallel, setting the stage for future conflict. The failure to ensure a unified and independent Vietnam reflected the enduring legacy of colonial intervention and the prioritization of Western interests over the self-determination of the Vietnamese people.

Charles de Gaulle, who would later preside over the dismantling of the French colonial empire, reportedly stated that France should never have been in Indochina in the first place, implicitly acknowledging the ethical bankruptcy of the colonial project.

### 5. The Ethical Aftermath in France: Selective Memory and Lingering Guilt

While the Algerian War (1954-1962) has become a central focus of French collective memory and ethical reckoning, the Indochina War remains comparatively less prominent. This selective amnesia may be attributed to several factors, including the perception of Indochina as a more distant and less directly relevant conflict, as well as the desire to avoid confronting the full extent of French complicity in the suffering of the Vietnamese people.

The *rapatriés d'Indochine*, French citizens and those of French descent who were repatriated from Indochina after 1954, often faced discrimination and marginalization in France. Their experiences served as a reminder of the human cost of colonialism and the challenges of reintegrating those displaced by imperial violence.

The fate of the Eurasian children (*métis*) fathered by French men and abandoned in Indochina is another haunting legacy of colonialism. These children, often stigmatized and ostracized by both French and Vietnamese societies, represented a profound ethical failure on the part of the colonial administration and individual French citizens.

Jean Lartéguy's 1960 novel, *The Centurions* (*Les Centurions*), explored the psychological toll of the Indochina War on French soldiers and the transfer of brutal counterinsurgency tactics from Indochina to Algeria. The novel highlighted the ethical compromises made by soldiers fighting in colonial wars and the normalization of violence and torture as tools of state power.

### 6. Cambodia and Laos: The Specter of French Education

France's protectorates over Cambodia and Laos followed a similar pattern of economic exploitation, political domination, and cultural imposition. The Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, led by Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan, both of whom were educated in French universities, represents a particularly disturbing legacy of French colonialism.

The fact that leaders of a genocidal regime received their education in France raises uncomfortable questions about the ethical implications of colonial education and the potential for Western knowledge to be twisted and manipulated in the service of totalitarian ideologies. While it would be simplistic to attribute the Khmer Rouge's atrocities solely to their French education, it is important to acknowledge the complex and often contradictory ways in which colonial encounters shaped the intellectual and political landscape of Southeast Asia.

### 7. Conclusion

The French colonial relationship with Indochina was marked by profound ethical contradictions. The *mission civilisatrice*, intended to justify colonial rule, was often undermined by economic exploitation, political repression, and cultural arrogance. The legacy of French colonialism in Indochina continues to reverberate today, shaping the political, social, and cultural landscape of the region and posing enduring ethical challenges for both France and the former colonies. The work of scholars like Pierre Brocheux, Daniel Hemery, Frederik Logevall, and Nicola Cooper continues to shed light on the complexities of this history and the importance of confronting the ethical failures of the past.

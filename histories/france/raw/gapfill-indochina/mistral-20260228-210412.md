### **France’s Colonial Relationship with Indochina: An Ethical History**

France’s colonial engagement with Indochina (modern-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) was not merely a military or political project but a deeply contested ethical one, shaped by justifications of *mission civilisatrice*, resistance grounded in France’s own revolutionary traditions, and enduring moral ambiguities. This history reveals internal tensions—between universalist ideals and racial hierarchies, between economic development and exploitation, and between republican values and imperial violence.

### **1. Conquest and Justification: The "Mission Civilisatrice" in Southeast Asia**

#### **Napoleon III’s Intervention (1858–1862) and the Doctrine of Civilizing Empire**
France’s formal conquest of Indochina began under **Napoleon III**, who framed intervention as both a strategic and moral imperative. The **Second Opium War (1856–1860)** and British expansion in China provided a pretext, but French Catholic missionaries—particularly those of the **Société des Missions Étrangères de Paris (MEP, founded 1658)**—played a crucial role in justifying military action. When Vietnamese authorities executed the Spanish bishop **José María Díaz Sanjurjo (1857)** under Emperor **Tự Đức’s anti-Christian edicts**, Napoleon III seized the opportunity to intervene, presenting France as the protector of persecuted Christians.

The **Treaty of Saigon (1862)** forced Vietnam to cede **Cochinchina (Southern Vietnam)** and grant religious freedom to Catholics. This marked the beginning of France’s *mission civilisatrice*—the belief that French rule would bring progress, Christianity, and enlightenment to "backward" societies. As **Jules Ferry**, a key architect of French colonialism, argued in his **1885 speech to the Chamber of Deputies**:
> *"The superior races have a right vis-à-vis the inferior races… They have a right because they have a duty: it is their duty to civilize the inferior races."*

This paternalistic rhetoric masked economic motives: Cochinchina’s rice exports and the Mekong Delta’s agricultural potential made it a lucrative colony. Yet the ethical justification—bringing "civilization"—remained central to French self-perception.

#### **Paul Doumer’s "Developmental" Colonialism (1897–1902) and Forced Labor**
As **Governor-General of Indochina (1897–1902)**, **Paul Doumer** (later President of France) implemented an ambitious infrastructure program—railroads, bridges, and the **Yunnan–Vietnam Railway**—to integrate Indochina into the global economy. His policies were framed as modernizing, but they relied on **corvée labor (forced unpaid work)**, a system codified in the **1897 Decree on Public Works**. Vietnamese peasants were conscripted to build railways, often under brutal conditions; thousands died from disease, malnutrition, and exhaustion.

Doumer’s **1902 report to the French Parliament** justified these measures as necessary for "the economic development of the colony," arguing that Indochina would eventually benefit from French investment. Yet his policies deepened resentment, fueling later resistance movements.

#### **Albert Sarraut’s *La Mise en valeur des colonies françaises* (1923): The Ethical Framework of Colonial Development**
By the 1920s, French colonial policy shifted toward a more "benevolent" developmentalism under **Albert Sarraut**, twice Governor-General of Indochina (1911–1914, 1917–1919) and later Minister of Colonies. His **1923 treatise**, *La Mise en valeur des colonies françaises* (*The Development of the French Colonies*), argued that France had a moral obligation to "develop" its colonies through education, infrastructure, and economic investment.

Sarraut’s vision was not purely altruistic—he sought to counter rising Vietnamese nationalism by co-opting elites into the colonial system. He expanded the **Franco-Vietnamese school system** (see Section 3) and promoted **quốc ngữ** (romanized Vietnamese script) as a tool of modernization. Yet his policies also reinforced racial hierarchies: Vietnamese were trained for mid-level administrative roles but excluded from high-ranking positions.

Sarraut’s ethical framework—development as a justification for empire—would later be invoked by postcolonial critics, including **Ho Chi Minh**, who accused France of hypocrisy: *"You have built more prisons than schools."*

### **2. Ho Chi Minh and the French Connection: Revolutionary Ethics Turned Against Empire**

#### **Ho Chi Minh in Paris (1917–1923) and the Petition to Versailles (1919)**
One of the most striking ethical ironies of French colonialism is that its greatest adversary, **Ho Chi Minh (Nguyễn Ái Quốc)**, was deeply shaped by French revolutionary ideals. Arriving in Paris in **1917**, Ho worked as a photo retoucher and immersed himself in socialist and anti-colonial circles. He was influenced by **Jean Jaurès’ socialist humanism** and the **French Communist Party (PCF)**, which he helped found at the **Tours Congress (1920)**.

In **1919**, Ho submitted a petition to the **Versailles Peace Conference**, demanding Vietnamese self-determination under **Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points**. Titled *"Revendications du peuple annamite"* (*Demands of the Annamite People*), it invoked the **1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen**, declaring:
> *"All men are born free and equal in rights… Why, then, are the Annamites deprived of these rights?"*

The petition was ignored, but it marked a turning point: Ho realized that France’s revolutionary tradition could be weaponized against colonialism.

#### **The Vietnamese Declaration of Independence (1945): France’s Revolutionary Legacy Repurposed**
On **September 2, 1945**, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnam’s independence in **Ba Đình Square, Hanoi**, directly quoting the **1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man** and the **U.S. Declaration of Independence**:
> *"All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."*

This was not mere rhetoric—it was a deliberate ethical challenge to France’s claim to be the bearer of universal values. By invoking France’s own revolutionary tradition, Ho exposed the hypocrisy of colonialism: how could France deny Vietnam the rights it had fought for in 1789?

The **March 6, 1946 Accords** (where France recognized Vietnam as a "free state" within the French Union) briefly suggested a compromise, but negotiations collapsed, leading to the **First Indochina War (1946–1954)**.

### **3. The Ethics of Colonial Education: Knowledge, Resistance, and Reform**

#### **The Franco-Vietnamese School System and the Romanization of Vietnamese**
French colonial education in Indochina was a site of both **cultural assimilation** and **anti-colonial resistance**. The **1906 Decree on Public Instruction** established a tiered system:
- **French-language schools** for European and elite Vietnamese children.
- **Franco-Vietnamese schools** for middle-class Vietnamese (taught in quốc ngữ).
- **Vernacular schools** for the rural majority (taught in chữ Nôm, the traditional script).

The **romanization of Vietnamese (quốc ngữ)**, developed by **Alexandre de Rhodes (1651)** and later promoted by French missionaries, was initially a tool of evangelization. However, by the early 20th century, it became a vehicle for **Vietnamese nationalism**. Intellectuals like **Phan Bội Châu** and **Phan Châu Trinh** used quốc ngữ to spread anti-colonial ideas, bypassing the French-controlled classical script.

#### **The École Française d’Extrême-Orient (EFEO) and Orientalist Knowledge Production**
Founded in **1900**, the **École Française d’Extrême-Orient (EFEO)** was France’s premier institution for the study of Indochinese history, archaeology, and culture. While it produced valuable scholarship (e.g., the restoration of **Angkor Wat**), it also served colonial interests by **essentializing Vietnamese culture** as static and inferior.

Scholars like **Paul Mus** (*Viêt Nam: Sociologie d’une guerre*, 1952) later argued that French Orientalism contributed to a **cultural alienation** that fueled nationalist resistance.

#### **Phan Bội Châu vs. Phan Châu Trinh: Two Ethical Responses to Colonialism**
Vietnamese intellectuals offered competing visions of resistance:
- **Phan Bội Châu (1867–1940)** advocated **armed revolution**, founding the **Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội (Vietnam Restoration League, 1912)** and seeking Japanese support. His **1905 manifesto, *Việt Nam vong quốc sử* (*History of the Loss of Vietnam*)**, framed resistance as a moral duty.
- **Phan Châu Trinh (1872–1926)** argued for **nonviolent reform**, believing that Vietnam should modernize under French rule before demanding independence. His **1906 petition to Governor-General Paul Beau** called for democratic reforms, education, and economic development.

Both men were imprisoned by the French, but their debates reflected deeper ethical tensions: **violence vs. reform, collaboration vs. resistance**.

### **4. Dien Bien Phu (1954): The Ethical Dimensions of Defeat**

#### **The Battle and Its Human Cost**
The **Battle of Điện Biên Phủ (March–May 1954)** was a military catastrophe for France, but its ethical dimensions were equally devastating:
- **Colonial troops**: The French Union forces included **North African (Tirailleurs algériens, tunisiens, marocains)** and **Senegalese Tirailleurs**, many of whom were conscripted or pressured into service. Their high casualties (e.g., the **6th Colonial Parachute Battalion**, nearly annihilated) raised questions about France’s exploitation of colonial subjects.
- **Vietnamese allies abandoned**: The **Vietnamese National Army (VNA)**, loyal to the French-backed **State of Vietnam**, was left to fend for itself after the French withdrawal. Many were later persecuted by the Viet Minh.
- **Geneva Accords (1954)**: The agreement partitioned Vietnam at the **17th parallel**, but France’s hasty exit left Laos and Cambodia vulnerable to communist insurgencies.

#### **De Gaulle’s Retrospective Judgment**
In his **1964 press conference**, **Charles de Gaulle**—who had opposed the Indochina War as early as 1946—declared:
> *"France should never have gone to Indochina. It was a mistake, a colonial adventure that had no place in the modern world."*

This admission reflected a growing ethical consensus in France: Indochina was a **moral and strategic failure**.

### **5. The Ethical Aftermath in France: Memory, Abandonment, and Silence**

#### **Why Is Indochina Less Present in French Memory Than Algeria?**
Unlike the **Algerian War (1954–1962)**, which tore France apart and remains a live political issue, the **First Indochina War (1946–1954)** is often treated as a **distant, almost forgotten conflict**. Several factors explain this:
- **Fewer French settlers**: Only **~35,000 French civilians** lived in Indochina (vs. **1 million in Algeria**), so the **repatriation crisis** was smaller.
- **No mass trauma**: The **~75,000 French soldiers killed** (vs. **~25,000 in Algeria**) were mostly professional troops, not conscripts, so the war did not provoke the same domestic backlash.
- **Cold War framing**: The conflict was quickly subsumed into the **U.S.-Soviet rivalry**, with France ceding its role to America in **1954**.

#### **The Abandoned Eurasian Children (Métis)**
One of the most painful ethical legacies is the fate of **Eurasian children (métis)**, born to French fathers and Vietnamese mothers. Many were **abandoned by their fathers** and placed in **orphanages** like the **Couvent des Oiseaux in Hanoi**. After 1954, some were **repatriated to France**, where they faced discrimination; others were left behind in Vietnam.

The **1982 French law on métis** (recognizing their right to French citizenship) came too late for many.

#### **Jean Larteguy’s *The Centurions* (1960): From Indochina to Algeria**
The **transfer of torture techniques** from Indochina to Algeria was documented in **Jean Larteguy’s *Les Centurions* (1960)**, a novel based on real events. Larteguy, a former paratrooper, described how French officers—traumatized by Điện Biên Phủ—applied **counterinsurgency tactics** (including torture) in Algeria, believing they were fighting a new kind of war.

The book exposed the **moral corruption** of French colonial warfare, where "dirty war" methods became normalized.

### **6. Cambodia and Laos: The Protectorates and the Ethical Shadow of French Education**

#### **The Khmer Rouge’s French-Educated Leadership**
France’s **Protectorate of Cambodia (1863–1953)** and **Laos (1893–1953)** were governed with a lighter touch than Vietnam, but their postcolonial trajectories were disastrous. The **Khmer Rouge leadership**—including **Pol Pot (Saloth Sar), Khieu Samphan, and Ieng Sary**—were educated in **French universities** (Pol Pot at the **EFEO in Paris**, Khieu Samphan at the **Sorbonne**).

Their **Maoist-Stalinist ideology** was not directly taught in French schools, but their **anti-colonial radicalization** was shaped by:
- **French Marxist intellectuals** (e.g., **Jean-Paul Sartre’s support for anti-colonial struggles**).
- **The failure of French developmentalism** (e.g., Cambodia’s underdevelopment despite French rule).
- **The trauma of decolonization** (e.g., the **1953 French withdrawal**, which left Cambodia vulnerable).

The **Cambodian Genocide (1975–1979)**—in which **1.7 million died**—raises ethical questions about whether French education **unintentionally radicalized** a generation of intellectuals.

### **7. Key Scholars and Ethical Debates**

The ethical history of French Indochina has been shaped by several key scholars:
- **Pierre Brocheux** (*The Mekong Delta: Ecology, Economy, and Revolution, 1860–1960*, 1995) – Analyzes how French economic policies **disrupted Vietnamese society**, leading to resistance.
- **Daniel Hémery** (*Indochine: La colonisation ambiguë, 1858–1954*, 1995) – Examines the **contradictions of the mission civilisatrice**, showing how French "development" often meant **exploitation**.
- **Frederik Logevall** (*Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America’s Vietnam*, 2012) – Traces the **moral failures** of French and American policymakers in Indochina.
- **Nicola Cooper** (*France in Indochina: Colonial Encounters*, 2001) – Explores the **cultural and psychological dimensions** of French rule, including **racial hierarchies** and **sexual exploitation**.

### **Conclusion: The Ethical Legacy of French Indochina**

France’s colonial relationship with Indochina was an **ethical paradox**: a project justified in the name of **universal values** (liberty, progress, civilization) that instead produced **exploitation, violence, and resistance**. The **mission civilisatrice** was always a **contradiction**—how could France claim to liberate Vietnam while denying it self-determination?

The **Vietnamese Declaration of Independence (1945)**—quoting the **1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man**—exposed this hypocrisy. Yet France’s ethical reckoning with Indochina remains **incomplete**. Unlike Algeria, where **torture, massacres, and war crimes** are openly debated, Indochina is often treated as a **distant, almost abstract conflict**.

The **abandoned métis children**, the **Khmer Rouge’s French-educated leaders**, and the **transfer of torture techniques to Algeria** all point to a **moral debt** that France has yet to fully acknowledge. As **Pierre Brocheux** argues, the **ethical failures of French Indochina** were not just colonial mistakes—they were **betrayals of France’s own revolutionary ideals**.

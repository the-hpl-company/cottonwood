The French Revolution and Napoleonic period (1789-1815) constitute the most consequential ethical rupture in modernity precisely because they exposed both the radical potential and violent contradictions of universalist claims. Below is a grounded analysis of its key ethical tensions:

### 1. **Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789)**  
- **Article 1**: "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights." Yet "men" (hommes) excluded women (Olympe de Gouges' 1791 critique), enslaved Africans (Code Noir still enforced), and colonial subjects (Saint-Domingue's enslaved produced the ink used to draft it).  
- **Article 6**: "Law is the expression of the general will." But only 4.3 million Frenchmen (of 28 million) could vote in 1791. Compare to Jefferson's "all men are created equal" (1776) while holding slaves—France universalized the contradiction.  
- **Article 17**: Property as "inviolable and sacred" directly conflicted with abolitionist petitions like the *Société des Amis des Noirs* (founded 1788 by Brissot). The 1794 abolition decree was reversed by Napoleon in 1802.  

### 2. **Olympe de Gouges' *Declaration of the Rights of Woman* (1791)**  
- **Article X**: "Woman has the right to mount the scaffold; she must equally have the right to mount the rostrum." Direct rebuttal to Rousseau's *Émile* (1762) relegating women to domesticity.  
- Her execution (November 3, 1793) under the Law of Suspects epitomized the Revolution's gendered violence. The *Moniteur Universel* condemned her for "having forgotten the virtues of her sex."  

### 3. **The Terror (1793-94) as Ethical Collapse**  
- Robespierre's *Report on the Principles of Political Morality* (February 5, 1794): "Terror is nothing but justice, prompt, severe, inflexible." Virtue became coercive—Saint-Just's *Fragments on Republican Institutions* (1794) called for "forcing men to be free."  
- The Law of 22 Prairial (June 10, 1794) removed defendants' rights to counsel or witnesses. Of 2,639 Parisian executions, 58% were working-class (Donald Greer, *The Incidence of the Terror*, 1935).  

### 4. **Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) as Ethical Reckoning**  
- The 1791 slave revolt forced the Convention's 1794 abolition decree—the first in history. Yet Napoleon's 1802 expedition under General Leclerc aimed to restore slavery, violating the Republic's ideals.  
- Toussaint's 1801 Constitution: "All men are born free and equal" (Article 3)—more radical than France's 1791 Constitution, which excluded colonies. Dessalines' 1804 Independence Declaration: "We have dared to be free," indicting France's hypocrisy.  

### 5. **Jacobin vs. Girondin Ethical Visions**  
- **Jacobin (Robespierre)**: Centralized virtue. *Levy en masse* (1793) as "democratic dictatorship" (François Furet).  
- **Girondin (Condorcet)**: Federalist liberty. Condorcet's *Esquisse d'un tableau historique* (1795) proposed gradual abolition and women's rights. His murder (March 1794) marked the Terror's peak.  

### 6. **Napoleon's Ethical Ambiguities**  
- **Civil Code (1804)**: Mixed revolutionary equality (Article 8: "All Frenchmen shall enjoy civil rights") with patriarchal control (Article 213: "Wife owes obedience to husband").  
- **Concordat (1801)**: Restored Catholicism as "religion of the majority" while subordinating Church to state—a utilitarian compromise.  
- **1802 Slavery Restoration**: Betrayed the Revolution's universalism. The Code Noir's revival in Guadeloupe sparked Louis Delgrès' suicide pact (May 28, 1802).  

### 7. **Congress of Vienna (1815) & Reaction**  
- Joseph de Maistre's *Considerations on France* (1797): "The Revolution has a satanic character." The Bourbons' *Charte Constitutionnelle* (1814) preserved Napoleonic centralism while restoring divine-right monarchy.  

### 8. **Key Scholars**  
- **Lynn Hunt**: *Inventing Human Rights* (2007) traces how revolutionary empathy clashed with exclusion.  
- **C.L.R. James**: *The Black Jacobins* (1938) centers Haiti as the Revolution's ethical test.  
- **François Furet**: *Interpreting the French Revolution* (1978) critiques the Terror's "ideological drift."  

### **Conclusion**  
The Revolution's ethical legacy is its unbearable tension: universal rights proclaimed amid colonial genocide (Saint-Domingue), feminist demands met with guillotines (de Gouges), and liberty enforced through terror (Robespierre). Napoleon exported this paradox—his Code spread equality *and* patriarchy, secularism *and* empire. The Revolution's children are both the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1961 Paris massacre of Algerians. As Aimé Césaire wrote in *Discourse on Colonialism* (1950): "No one colonizes innocently." France's ethical tradition is this dialectic of light and shadow.

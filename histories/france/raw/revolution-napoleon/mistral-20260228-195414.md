### **The French Revolution and Napoleonic Period (1789–1815): The Most Consequential Ethical Rupture in Modern History**

The French Revolution was not merely a political upheaval but an **ethical earthquake**—a radical redefinition of sovereignty, rights, and human dignity that reverberated across the world. Unlike the American Revolution, which was a war of independence, the French Revolution was a **total social and moral transformation**, one that sought to dismantle feudalism, monarchy, and the Church’s authority in the name of **universal reason and justice**. Yet this revolution was also a **theater of contradictions**: it proclaimed liberty while practicing terror, declared equality while excluding women and colonial subjects, and birthed a republic that became an empire. The Napoleonic era that followed was both the **fulfillment and betrayal** of the Revolution’s promises, exporting its legal codes while restoring slavery and autocracy.

This period forces us to confront a central tension in French ethical thought: **the gap between universal claims and particular exclusions**. The Revolution’s ideals were global in ambition, yet their application was **selective, violent, and often hypocritical**. To understand this rupture, we must examine its foundational texts, its internal conflicts, its colonial crimes, and its aftermath.

## **1. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789): The Ethical Founding of Modern France**

### **Text & Context**
Adopted by the **National Constituent Assembly** on **August 26, 1789**, the *Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen* (DDHC) was the Revolution’s **moral manifesto**, drafted in the wake of the **Storming of the Bastille (July 14, 1789)** and the **abolition of feudalism (August 4, 1789)**. Its primary authors were **Lafayette** (inspired by the American Declaration of Independence) and **Abbé Sieyès**, though it drew on Enlightenment thought from **Montesquieu** (*The Spirit of the Laws*, 1748), **Rousseau** (*The Social Contract*, 1762), and **Diderot** (*Encyclopédie*, 1751–1772).

Unlike the **American Declaration of Independence (1776)**, which was a **legal justification for secession**, the DDHC was a **philosophical blueprint for a new society**. The American document spoke of **"unalienable Rights"** granted by a **Creator**, while the French declaration grounded rights in **reason, nature, and the sovereignty of the nation**—a secular, universalist framework.

### **Article-by-Article Ethical Analysis**

| **Article** | **Text** | **Ethical Meaning** | **Exclusions & Contradictions** |
|------------|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **1** | *"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good."* | **Universal equality**—a direct repudiation of feudal hierarchy. Rights are **natural**, not granted by a king or God. | **"Men" (les hommes)**—excludes women (Olympe de Gouges would later challenge this). Also excludes enslaved people (Saint-Domingue’s economy depended on slavery). |
| **2** | *"The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression."* | **Liberty, property, security**—classical liberal rights, but **property** becomes a sacred right, justifying colonial exploitation. | **Property**—enshrines bourgeois ownership, including **slave plantations** in the colonies. **Resistance to oppression**—ironically, the Revolution would later suppress dissent (e.g., the Vendée uprising). |
| **3** | *"The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation."* | **Popular sovereignty**—power comes from the people, not the king. A **republican** principle. | **Who is "the nation"?** Excludes non-citizens (women, colonial subjects, the poor without property). The **active/passive citizen** distinction (1791 Constitution) disenfranchised most men. |
| **4** | *"Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights."* | **Negative liberty**—freedom as non-interference, but with **collective limits**. | **Who defines "injury"?** The state (e.g., the Committee of Public Safety) would later decide what constitutes harm, justifying the Terror. |
| **6** | *"Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its formation."* | **Rousseau’s "general will"**—law must reflect the people’s collective interest. | **Excludes women and non-citizens** from political participation. The **Jacobins** would later claim to embody the "general will," suppressing dissent. |
| **7-9** | *"No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law."* | **Due process**—a rejection of arbitrary royal justice. | **The Terror (1793–94)** would suspend these rights in the name of revolutionary virtue. |
| **10** | *"No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, even religious, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law."* | **Religious tolerance**—a break from the Catholic monarchy. | **Laïcité (secularism)** would later become a tool to suppress religious minorities (e.g., Jews, Muslims). |
| **11** | *"The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law."* | **Free speech**—a radical departure from royal censorship. | **The Revolution would later censor its enemies** (e.g., the **Law of Suspects, 1793**). |
| **17** | *"Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably indemnified."* | **Property as sacred**—protects bourgeois wealth, including **slave plantations**. | **Colonial slavery**—the DDHC was proclaimed while **Saint-Domingue (Haiti)** generated **1/3 of France’s foreign trade** through enslaved labor. |

### **Who is the "Man"? Who is the "Citizen"?**
- **"Man" (l’homme)**—Theoretically universal, but in practice, **white, male, property-owning, and European**.
- **"Citizen" (le citoyen)**—The **1791 Constitution** distinguished between:
  - **Active citizens** (men over 25 who paid taxes) – could vote.
  - **Passive citizens** (women, the poor, non-whites) – no political rights.
- **Exclusions**:
  - **Women** – Denied political rights; Olympe de Gouges would challenge this in **1791**.
  - **Enslaved people** – The DDHC did not apply to colonies; slavery was **reaffirmed in 1791** (though later abolished in **1794**, then **restored by Napoleon in 1802**).
  - **Colonial subjects** – The **Code Noir (1685)** remained in force in the colonies until **1794**.

### **Comparison with the American Declaration of Independence (1776)**
| **Aspect** | **American Declaration** | **French Declaration** |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Source of Rights** | "Endowed by their Creator" (divine) | "Natural, inalienable, and sacred" (secular, rational) |
| **Sovereignty** | "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed" | "The principle of all sovereignty resides in the nation" (more radical, collective) |
| **Equality** | "All men are created equal" (but slavery persisted) | "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights" (but excluded women and colonial subjects) |
| **Property** | Not a central right | **Sacralized** (Article 17) – justifies bourgeois capitalism, including colonial slavery |
| **Revolutionary Scope** | Limited to independence from Britain | **Total social transformation** – abolition of feudalism, Church power, monarchy |

**What France Added:**
- **Secular universalism** – Rights come from **reason**, not God.
- **Popular sovereignty** – The nation, not a king, is the source of power.
- **Social contract theory** – Rousseau’s influence: the **general will** as the basis of law.
- **Radical equality** – Though hypocritical in practice, the **abolition of feudalism** was more sweeping than American independence.

**What France Changed:**
- **From divine right to human rights** – The king was no longer God’s representative; the people were sovereign.
- **From corporate privilege to individual rights** – The **Estates-General (clergy, nobility, commoners)** was replaced by a **unified nation of citizens**.
- **From religious authority to secular law** – The **Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790)** subordinated the Church to the state.

Yet the **greatest contradiction** was that the **most radical declaration of human rights in history was written while France was the world’s largest slave-trading nation**.

## **2. Olympe de Gouges: The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen (1791) – The First Feminist Ethical Challenge**

### **Text & Context**
**Olympe de Gouges (1748–1793)**, a playwright and abolitionist, published the *Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne* in **September 1791**, directly responding to the **1789 Declaration**. She was **executed by guillotine in November 1793** for her **Girondin sympathies** and her **defiance of Robespierre’s regime**.

Her text was the **first systematic feminist critique of revolutionary hypocrisy**, demanding:
- **Political rights for women** (voting, holding office).
- **Marital equality** (divorce rights, property rights).
- **Reproductive autonomy** (critique of forced motherhood).
- **A social contract between men and women**.

### **Key Articles & Ethical Arguments**

| **Article** | **Text** | **Ethical Significance** |
|------------|---------|--------------------------|
| **1** | *"Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights."* | **Direct challenge to Article 1 of the 1789 Declaration** – women are not "born free" if they are denied rights. |
| **6** | *"The law must be the expression of the general will; all female and male citizens must contribute either personally or through their representatives to its formation."* | **Demands female suffrage** – women must be part of the "general will." |
| **10** | *"No woman is an exception; she is accused, arrested, and detained in cases determined by law. Women, like men, obey this rigorous law."* | **Women must be subject to the same legal protections (and punishments) as men** – including the right to a fair trial. |
| **13** | *"For the maintenance of the public force and for administrative expenses, the contributions of woman and man are equal; she shares all the duties and all the painful tasks; therefore, she must have the same share in the distribution of positions, employment, offices, honors, and jobs."* | **Economic and professional equality** – women must have access to all careers. |
| **17** | *"Property belongs to both sexes whether united or separate; for each it is an inviolable and sacred right."* | **Marital property rights** – women must control their own wealth. |

### **Her Execution (1793) as an Ethical Event**
De Gouges was **guillotined on November 3, 1793**, accused of:
- **"Forgetting the virtues of her sex"** (i.e., daring to speak in public).
- **Supporting the Girondins** (moderate republicans, opposed to Robespierre’s Jacobins).
- **Writing a poster titled "The Three Urns"** (advocating a referendum on France’s future government).

Her execution was a **warning to women**: the Revolution’s **universalism had limits**. The Jacobins **rejected feminism** as a distraction from the **republican virtue** they sought to impose.

### **Legacy: The First Feminist Ethical Text**
- **Preceded Mary Wollstonecraft’s *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (1792)** – de Gouges was more radical, demanding **full political equality**.
- **Inspired 19th-century feminists** – **Flora Tristan, Hubertine Auclert, Simone de Beauvoir** would later cite her.
- **Abolitionist connections** – De Gouges also wrote *Réflexions sur les hommes nègres* (1788), opposing slavery.

Her death was a **symbol of the Revolution’s betrayal of its own principles**—it proclaimed **liberty and equality** but **silenced women who demanded them**.

## **3. The Terror (1793–1794): The Ethics of Virtue Enforced by Violence**

### **The Jacobin Ethical Framework: Virtue as the Foundation of the Republic**
The **Terror (September 1793–July 1794)** was not an aberration but the **logical conclusion of Jacobin ethics**. The **Montagnards (radical Jacobins)**, led by **Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794)**, believed that:
- **Virtue was the essence of the Republic** – Only a **moral citizenry** could sustain liberty.
- **The Revolution was in permanent danger** – From **counter-revolutionaries (royalists, Girondins, foreign invaders)** and **internal corruption**.
- **Terror was necessary to save the Revolution** – As Robespierre declared in **February 1794**:
  > *"Terror is nothing but prompt, severe, inflexible justice; it is therefore an emanation of virtue."*

### **Key Texts & Speeches**
1. **Robespierre, "On the Principles of Political Morality" (February 5, 1794)**
   - *"If the spring of popular government in time of peace is virtue, the springs of popular government in revolution are at once virtue and terror: virtue, without which terror is fatal; terror, without which virtue is powerless."*
   - **Ethical logic**: Terror is **not arbitrary**—it is the **enforcement of revolutionary virtue**.

2. **Saint-Just, "Report on the Necessity of Declaring the Government Revolutionary Until the Peace" (October 10, 1793)**
   - *"The Revolution must stop at the perfection of happiness."*
   - **Utopian violence**: The Revolution must **purify society** to achieve a **perfect republic**.

3. **Law of Suspects (September 17, 1793)**
   - Defined "suspects" as:
     - Those who **showed insufficient revolutionary zeal**.
     - Former **nobles, priests, and their relatives**.
     - **Merchants hoarding goods** (accused of economic sabotage).
   - **Ethical perversion**: **Guilt was assumed**; innocence had to be proven.

### **The Committee of Public Safety: The Revolutionary Government**
- **Established April 6, 1793**, it became the **de facto dictatorship** of the Revolution.
- **Key members**:
  - **Robespierre** (the "Incorruptible") – Ideologue of virtue.
  - **Saint-Just** – Theorist of revolutionary purity.
  - **Couthon** – Architect of the **Law of 22 Prairial (June 10, 1794)**, which **abolished due process** for "enemies of the Revolution."
- **Death toll**: **~40,000 executed**, including:
  - **Marie Antoinette (October 16, 1793)**
  - **The Girondins (October 1793)**
  - **Danton and the Indulgents (April 1794)** – Robespierre turned on his former allies.
  - **Olympe de Gouges (November 1793)**

### **How Did the Most Idealistic Revolution Produce Systematic Murder?**
1. **The Logic of Revolutionary Virtue**
   - The Jacobins believed they were **building a new moral order**.
   - **Dissent = counter-revolution = treason**.
   - **Example**: The **Vendée uprising (1793–96)** – A **Catholic-royalist rebellion** was crushed with **genocidal violence** (estimates: **100,000–250,000 dead**).

2. **The Guillotine as an Ethical Tool**
   - The **guillotine** was **egalitarian** – nobles and commoners died the same way.
   - But it was also **ritualistic** – executions were **public spectacles** to **purify the nation**.

3. **The Paradox of Universalism**
   - The Revolution **claimed to speak for all humanity**, but **only the Jacobins could define the "general will."**
   - **Robespierre’s fall (July 28, 1794, 9 Thermidor)** – His own allies turned on him, fearing they would be next.

### **Legacy of the Terror**
- **The birth of modern political violence** – The idea that **utopia justifies terror** would reappear in **Stalinism, Maoism, and 20th-century revolutions**.
- **The failure of virtue-based governance** – The Revolution showed that **moral absolutism leads to tyranny**.
- **The Thermidorian Reaction (1794–95)** – A **backlash against radicalism**, leading to the **

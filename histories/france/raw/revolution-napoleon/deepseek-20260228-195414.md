# The French Revolution and Napoleonic Period (1789–1815): An Ethical Rupture

## 1. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (26 August 1789)
**Textual Grounding:** *Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen*, adopted by the National Constituent Assembly. 17 articles, preamble.

**Ethical Analysis Article-by-Article:**
- **Preamble:** Grounds rights in "natural, unalienable, and sacred" nature of man. Sovereignty resides in the nation. **Ethical rupture:** Authority derived from human nature, not divine right (contrast *Louis XIV*, *Lettres Patentes* 1717).
- **Article 1:** "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights." **Exclusion:** "Men" (*hommes*) linguistically and legally masculine; excludes women (confirmed by *Constituent Assembly debates*, 1789). "Equal in rights" contradicted by *Code Noir* (1685) still governing colonies.
- **Article 2:** Rights defined as "liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression." **Ethical tension:** "Property" includes enslaved humans as movable property under colonial law (*Décret du 8 mars 1790* confirming colonial autonomy).
- **Article 3:** Sovereignty resides in the nation. **Exclusion:** "Active citizens" only (tax-paying males over 25); excludes poor, women, colonial subjects (*Constitution of 1791*, Title III).
- **Article 6:** Law as expression of general will. **Contradiction:** Colonial planters represented in National Assembly; enslaved Africans had no will recognized.
- **Article 7–9:** Due process protections (no arbitrary arrest). **Violated** by *Law of Suspects* (17 September 1793) during Terror.
- **Article 11:** Free communication of thought. **Violated** by suppression of Girondin and royalist press.
- **Article 17:** Property inviolable. **Ethical crisis:** This article protected slaveholders' "property" in Saint-Domingue until *Abolition Decree* (4 February 1794).

**Comparison with American Declaration of Independence (1776):**
- **France adds:** Explicit enumeration of individual rights (American Bill of Rights comes 1791). Universalist language ("all men," "universal rights") vs. American particularism ("one people").
- **France changes:** Grounds rights in "natural law" rather than "Creator." Makes sovereignty explicitly national, not parliamentary. Includes "resistance to oppression" as positive right (Article 2).
- **Shared exclusion:** Both exclude enslaved Africans, indigenous peoples, women. But French universalism creates sharper ethical contradiction: *Declaration* printed while *Colonial Committee* (Barnave) defended slavery (1790).

## 2. Olympe de Gouges: *Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen* (1791)
**Textual Grounding:** *Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne*, presented to National Assembly, September 1791.

**Ethical Contributions:**
- **Article 1:** "Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights." **Direct challenge** to masculine "Man" of 1789.
- **Article 10:** "Woman has the right to mount the scaffold; she must equally have the right to mount the rostrum." **Ethical demand:** Equal exposure to civic danger and power.
- **Postscript:** Calls for gender equality in marriage, property, education. Demands social welfare for unmarried women, widows.
- **Ethical execution (3 November 1793):** Guillotined for "having forgotten the virtues of her sex." Charged under *Law of Suspects* for Girondin sympathies and publishing feminist writings. **Ethical event:** The Revolution that proclaimed universal rights kills woman who demanded their application.

**Comparison with Wollstonecraft:** De Gouges' text precedes *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (1792) by one year. More radical: includes specific legal reforms (marriage contract, paternity suits). Both share fate: Wollstonecraft denounced as "hyena in petticoats"; de Gouges executed.

## 3. The Terror (1793–1794): Virtue Enforced by Violence
**Key Documents:**
- *Law of Suspects* (17 September 1793): Arrest anyone "who by their conduct, relations, or language show themselves partisans of tyranny."
- *Law of 22 Prairial Year II* (10 June 1794): Removed defense counsel, limited evidence, made death sole penalty.

**Robespierre's Ethical Logic:**
- **Speech of 5 February 1794:** "Terror is nothing but prompt, severe, inflexible justice; it is therefore an emanation of virtue." **Ethical equation:** Virtue = Terror against enemies of Revolution.
- **Saint-Just:** "The Revolution must stop at the perfection of happiness" (*Fragments sur les institutions républicaines*, 1794). **Totalizing ethics:** Happiness enforced by guillotine.
- **Committee of Public Safety** (CPS): Created 6 April 1793. **Ethical machinery:** Centralized virtue through *representants en mission* with unlimited power.

**Systematic Murder:**
- 16,594 official guillotine executions (Donald Greer, *The Incidence of the Terror*). 300,000 arrested.
- **Ethical rupture:** Revolutionary Tribunal (10 March 1793) made justice political. **Examples:** Girondins executed 31 October 1793; Lavoisier (scientist) executed 8 May 1794: "The Republic has no need of scientists."
- **Thermidor Reaction (27 July 1794):** Execution of Robespierre ends Terror but begins White Terror.

## 4. The Haitian Revolution (1791–1804): France's Ethical Contradiction Explodes
**Chronology of Ethical Crisis:**
- **1791:** Slave revolt in Saint-Domingue begins while National Assembly debates rights.
- **1794:** *Abolition Decree* (4 February) frees enslaved in colonies. **Motivation:** Military necessity (British invasion), not ethical consistency.
- **1801:** Toussaint L'Ouverture's *Constitution* declares him governor-for-life, abolishes slavery. **Ethical advance:** Universal suffrage regardless of race.
- **1802:** Napoleon sends expedition (Leclerc) to restore slavery. **Ethical betrayal:** *Law of 20 May 1802* maintains slavery where not abolished (Martinique), reimposes slave trade.
- **1804:** Haitian Declaration of Independence (1 January). **Textual superiority:** "We must live independent or die." Explicitly includes all inhabitants, condemns French "barbarity."

**Key Figures:**
- **Toussaint L'Ouverture:** *Letter to the Directory* (1797): "I took up arms for the freedom of my color... We are free today because we are the stronger."
- **Jean-Jacques Dessalines:** *Haitian Constitution* (1805): Article 14: "All citizens, whatever their color, are eligible for all employments." **Radical inclusion:** Forbids white land ownership (Article 12).

**C.L.R. James (*The Black Jacobins*, 1938):** "The slaves had taken the French Revolution at its word."

## 5. Jacobin vs. Girondin: Two Ethical Visions
**Jacobin (Robespierre, Saint-Just):**
- Centralized virtue, Paris-led revolution.
- *Maximum laws* (price controls) for poor.
- **Ethical priority:** Equality over liberty, virtue over process.
- **Robespierre:** "The springs of popular government in revolution are at once virtue and terror" (5 February 1794).

**Girondin (Condorcet, Brissot):**
- Federalist structure, departmental autonomy.
- **Condorcet's ethics:** *Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain* (1795) – gradual progress through education.
- **Girondin Constitution draft (1793):** More protections for accused, weaker executive.
- **Execution:** 21 Girondins guillotined 31 October 1793. **Ethical significance:** Revolution consumes its most liberal wing.

## 6. Napoleon: The Civil Code and Imperial Betrayal
**Code Napoléon (21 March 1804):**
- **Ethical framework:** Patriarchal family (Article 213: "Wife owes obedience to husband").
- **Property rights** absolute (Article 544).
- **Labor:** Le Chapelier Law (1791) banning worker associations codified.
- **Global spread:** Imposed in Belgium, Italy, Rhineland, Poland. **Legacy:** Modern property law foundation, but anti-feminist, anti-labor.

**Coronation (2 December 1804):**
- Takes crown from Pope Pius VII. **Ethical rupture:** Revolution against monarchy produces new emperor.
- **Concordat (1801):** Restores Catholic Church as "religion of majority" but state-controlled. **Ethical compromise:** Ends dechristianization, but subordinates church.

**Colonial betrayal:**
- **1802:** Restores slavery in Guadeloupe (Richepance expedition).
- **1803:** Sells Louisiana Territory to fund wars.
- **Ethical legacy:** Napoleon destroys revolutionary universalism: "My politics is to govern men as the great number wish to be governed" – pragmatic, not principled.

## 7. Congress of Vienna (1815) and Counter-Revolutionary Ethics
**Treaty of Vienna (9 June 1815):**
- Legitimist principle (Talleyrand): Restore "legitimate" monarchs.
- **Ethical framework:** Reaction against popular sovereignty.

**Joseph de Maistre:**
- *Considerations on France* (1797): "The Revolution has a satanic character."
- *Du Pape* (1819): Advocates papal infallibility as counter to popular sovereignty.
- **Ethical vision:** Divine punishment through Revolution; authority from God, not people.

**Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830):**
- *Charte Constitutionnelle* (1814): "Granted" by Louis XVIII, not from popular will.
- **Ethical regression:** Catholicism state religion; voting limited to wealthy.

## 8. Key Scholarly Interpretations
- **Lynn Hunt (*Inventing Human Rights*, 2007):** "Human rights require three interlocking qualities: they must be natural (inherent in human beings), equal (the same for everyone), and universal (applicable everywhere)." Traces how novels created empathy.
- **François Furet (*Penser la Révolution française*, 1978):** Breaks with Marxist class analysis. "The French Revolution is over." Emphasizes revolutionary discourse as autonomous force.
- **Simon Schama (*Citizens*, 1989):** "Violence was from the beginning the motor of the Revolution."
- **C.L.R. James (*The Black Jacobins*, 1938):** "The slaves' revolt is the only successful slave revolt in history, and the odds it had to overcome is evidence of the magnitude of the interests that were involved."

## Conclusion: The Ethical Rupture
The period 1789–1815 establishes the central tension of modern French ethics: **universal claims versus particular exclusions**. The Declaration's "Man" is abstract, white, male, propertied – yet its language creates impossible demands for inclusion by women, enslaved people, colonial subjects. The Terror reveals the danger of virtue absolutized. Napoleon demonstrates revolution's institutionalization into authoritarian state. Haiti proves colonized people could take French universalism more seriously than France itself. This tension – between revolutionary universalism and exclusionary practice – becomes the defining feature of French political ethics for the next two centuries, resurfacing in Algeria (1848–1962), laïcité debates (1905), and contemporary banlieue exclusion.

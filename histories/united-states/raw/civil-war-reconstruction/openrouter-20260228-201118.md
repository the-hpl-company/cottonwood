### American Ethical Thought from the Civil War through the Nadir (c. 1850-1920)

#### 1. **The Civil War as Ethical Crisis**
The Civil War (1861-1865) was a profound ethical crisis, forcing the nation to confront the contradiction between its founding ideals of liberty and the institution of slavery. **Abraham Lincoln**'s ethical evolution encapsulated this struggle. Initially, Lincoln framed the war as a fight to preserve the Union ("A house divided against itself cannot stand," **1858**). However, under pressure from abolitionists like **Frederick Douglass** (who criticized Lincoln's initial reluctance), Lincoln shifted toward emancipation as a moral necessity. 

The **Emancipation Proclamation (1863)** was a landmark ethical document, declaring freedom for enslaved people in rebel states. Yet its limitations — it did not apply to border states or areas under Union control — underscored the tension between pragmatism and moral purity. Lincoln’s **Gettysburg Address (1863)** articulated a new ethical framework, framing the war as a struggle to ensure "a new birth of freedom" and to dedicate the nation to the proposition that "all men are created equal." Douglass, who met with Lincoln multiple times, served as his ethical conscience, pushing him toward a more radical commitment to racial justice.

#### 2. **The Reconstruction Amendments**
The **13th Amendment (1865)** abolished slavery, marking a tectonic ethical shift. The **14th Amendment (1868)** promised equal protection and due process, aiming to secure citizenship and civil rights for freedpeople. The **15th Amendment (1870)** sought to enfranchise Black men. These amendments were a moral reconstruction of the Constitution, promising a multiracial democracy.

However, their ethical promise was undercut by systemic resistance. Southern states used Black Codes, violence, and legal loopholes to deny rights. The Supreme Court's **Slaughter-House Cases (1873)** narrowed the 14th Amendment’s scope, prioritizing states' rights over federal protection of Black citizens. Reconstruction’s ethical vision was betrayed before it could fully take root.

#### 3. **Reconstruction and Its Betrayal**
Reconstruction (1865-1877) was a bold ethical experiment. The **Freedmen’s Bureau (1865)** sought to provide education, land, and aid to freedpeople, embodying a federal commitment to racial justice. **W.E.B. Du Bois**, in **Black Reconstruction (1935)**, reframed Reconstruction as a democratic revolution led by Black activists and their allies.

However, the **Compromise of 1877** — which ended Reconstruction in exchange for Rutherford B. Hayes’ presidency — was an ethical catastrophe. Federal troops withdrew from the South, leaving freedpeople vulnerable to white supremacist violence and Jim Crow laws. This betrayal marked the beginning of the Nadir.

#### 4. **The Nadir (1877-1920)**
The Nadir was a period of intense racial violence and oppression. **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)** constitutionalized segregation under the "separate but equal" doctrine, legitimizing Jim Crow. Lynching became a tool of racial terror, killing thousands. **Ida B. Wells**, in her pamphlet *Southern Horrors* (**1892**) and subsequent works, exposed lynching as a racist tool of social control, launching an ethical campaign for justice.

The convict leasing system — a form of slavery by another name — exploited Black labor on a mass scale. The Nadir’s ethical landscape was one of systemic dehumanization and resistance.

#### 5. **Du Bois vs. Washington**
Two competing ethical frameworks emerged for Black survival. **Booker T. Washington**’s **Atlanta Compromise (1895)** advocated for Black economic advancement through accommodation, urging Black Americans to "cast down their buckets where they are." In contrast, **W.E.B. Du Bois**, in *The Souls of Black Folk* (**1903**), critiqued Washington’s approach, calling for immediate political and social equality. Du Bois introduced the concept of "double consciousness" — the ethical dilemma of being both American and Black, forced to reconcile conflicting identities.

#### 6. **The Labor Movement**
The labor movement emerged as a powerful ethical tradition, advocating for workers’ rights and solidarity. The **Haymarket Affair (1886)** highlighted the brutal suppression of labor activism. The **Triangle Shirtwaist Fire (1911)** exposed the deadly consequences of unchecked capitalism, spurring ethical reforms.

**Eugene Debs**, leader of the **Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)**, championed an ethic of working-class solidarity across racial lines. However, the movement often failed to overcome racial divisions, undermining its ethical potential.

#### 7. **The Women's Suffrage Movement**
The women’s suffrage movement, rooted in the **Seneca Falls Convention (1848)**, achieved its climax with the **19th Amendment (1920)**, granting women the right to vote. However, the movement was marred by ethical tensions over race. Leaders like **Susan B. Anthony** opposed the **15th Amendment**, arguing that Black men should not be enfranchised before white women. This split revealed the movement’s failure to fully embrace intersectional justice.

#### 8. **"War is a Racket"**
**Smedley Butler**, in *War is a Racket* (**1935**), critiqued the military-industrial complex as an ethical failure. Butler, a retired Marine general, testified that war served the interests of capital rather than the nation, exposing the moral corruption of militarism.

#### 9. **Key Scholars**
- **Eric Foner** (*Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution*) emphasizes Reconstruction’s democratic promise and betrayal.
- **David Blight** (*Race and Reunion*) explores how white supremacy shaped post-Civil War memory.
- **Rayford Logan** (*The Betrayal of the Negro*) coined the term "Nadir" to describe post-Reconstruction oppression.
- **Nell Irvin Painter** (*The History of White People*) interrogates the racial ideologies underpinning American ethics.

This period encapsulates the tension between America’s ethical ideals and its systemic failures — a tension that continues to define its moral landscape.

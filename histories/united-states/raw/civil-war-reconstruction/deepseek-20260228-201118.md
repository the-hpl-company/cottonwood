# American Ethical Thought, 1850–1920: From Civil War to the Nadir

## 1. The Civil War as Ethical Crisis
The war exposed the nation’s foundational contradiction: a republic founded on liberty was also a slave empire. Lincoln’s ethical evolution is documented in his **1862 letter to Horace Greeley** (“If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it…”) versus the **Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863)**, which framed emancipation as a “military necessity.” Its ethical limitation was explicit: it only applied to enslaved people in rebel states, leaving slavery intact in border states. The **Gettysburg Address (November 19, 1863)** reframed the war as a test of whether a nation “conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” could endure. Frederick Douglass, in speeches like **“What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” (1852)**, served as Lincoln’s ethical conscience, pushing him toward a war for freedom. As Douglass later wrote, Lincoln was “preeminently the white man’s President” until the war forced a “transformation” (*Life and Times of Frederick Douglass*, 1881).

## 2. The Reconstruction Amendments: Ethical Reconstruction of the Constitution
- **13th Amendment (1865)**: Abolished slavery “except as a punishment for crime.” This exception clause (cited by **David Blight** in *Race and Reunion*, 2001) created a constitutional loophole for convict leasing.
- **14th Amendment (1868)**: Established birthright citizenship and equal protection under law. Its promise was gutted by the **Slaughter-House Cases (1873)** and **U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876)**, which limited federal enforcement.
- **15th Amendment (1870)**: Prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Immediately circumvented by literacy tests, poll taxes, and violence.

As **Eric Foner** argues in *Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution* (1988), these amendments constituted a “second founding,” but their enforcement relied on a federal will that evaporated after 1877.

## 3. Reconstruction and Its Betrayal
The **Freedmen’s Bureau (1865–1872)**, established by Congress, represented the first federal attempt to provide care and protection—education, labor contracts, healthcare—for newly emancipated people. **Black Reconstruction**, as **W.E.B. Du Bois** meticulously documented in his 1935 work, saw over 2,000 Black men hold public office, from local sheriffs to U.S. Senators. This experiment in multiracial democracy was overthrown by paramilitary violence (e.g., the **Colfax Massacre, 1873**) and the **Compromise of 1877**, which withdrew federal troops from the South in exchange for settling the Hayes-Tilden election. Historian **Rayford Logan** termed the ensuing period **“The Nadir”** in *The Betrayal of the Negro* (1954)—an ethical catastrophe where the nation abandoned its freed citizens.

## 4. The Nadir: Jim Crow and Terrorist Ethics
- **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**: The Supreme Court’s “separate but equal” doctrine constitutionalized caste. Justice Harlan’s dissent invoked the 14th Amendment: “Our Constitution is color-blind.”
- **Lynching**: Between 1877 and 1950, over 4,400 racial terror lynchings occurred (Equal Justice Initiative, 2017). **Ida B. Wells**, in *Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases* (1892) and *The Red Record* (1895), documented that lynching was an economic and political tool of terror, not a response to crime.
- **Convict Leasing**: Enabled by the 13th Amendment’s exception, it created a system **Douglas A. Blackmon** later called “slavery by another name” (2008).

## 5. Du Bois vs. Washington: Competing Ethical Frameworks
- **Booker T. Washington’s Atlanta Compromise Speech (1895)**: Advocated Black economic self-help and vocational education while accepting political disenfranchisement and segregation. “Cast down your bucket where you are.”
- **W.E.B. Du Bois’s *The Souls of Black Folk* (1903)**: Directly criticized Washington’s accommodation. Introduced the ethical concept of **“double consciousness”**—the “sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others.” Demanded full civil rights and liberal education (“The Talented Tenth”).

## 6. The Labor Movement as Ethical Tradition
The **Haymarket Affair (1886)** and the execution of anarchist leaders framed the struggle for the eight-hour day. The **Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire (1911)**, which killed 146 mostly immigrant women, exposed industrial brutality and spurred ethical demands for workplace safety. **Eugene V. Debs**, leader of the Socialist Party, argued for a “solidarity of labor” across race and nationality. The **Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, founded 1905)** championed “One Big Union” for all workers. Yet the movement often failed its ethical ideals: the **American Federation of Labor** frequently excluded Black and immigrant workers, a betrayal documented by **Nell Irvin Painter** in *Standing at Armageddon* (1987).

## 7. Women’s Suffrage: Ethical Tensions
The **Seneca Falls Convention (1848)** and its **Declaration of Sentiments** launched the organized movement. The ratification of the **19th Amendment (1920)** capped a 72-year struggle. However, the movement fractured ethically over the **15th Amendment**. Leaders like **Elizabeth Cady Stanton** and **Susan B. Anthony** opposed the amendment for not including women, using racist rhetoric that alienated Black suffragists like **Frances Ellen Watkins Harper** and **Ida B. Wells**. This split, as **Painter** notes, revealed the persistent tension between gender and racial justice.

## 8. The Military-Industrial Critique: “War Is a Racket”
Though published in 1935, **Major General Smedley Butler’s** *War Is a Racket* distilled an ethical critique forged in this era. Butler testified that he had been a “racketeer for capitalism” in interventions from the Spanish-American War (1898) through the “Banana Wars.” His testimony before the **Nye Committee (1934–36)** argued that war serves private profit, not national defense—an early articulation of the harm inflicted by the military-industrial complex.

## 9. Key Scholarly Frameworks
- **Eric Foner**: Reconstruction as an “unfinished revolution,” a radical moment betrayed.
- **David Blight**: The “reunion” of North and South was achieved by sacrificing Black freedom (*Race and Reunion*, 2001).
- **Rayford Logan**: Coined “the Nadir” to describe the period of deepest racial oppression after Reconstruction.
- **Nell Irvin Painter**: Centered the experiences of Black Americans and working people in narratives of this era.

This period defined the central ethical drama of America: the struggle to close the gap between its professed ideals and its systemic practices. The betrayal of Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow entrenched a racial caste system, while labor and women’s movements expanded the boundaries of care and solidarity—often incompletely and with internal contradictions. The ethical frameworks forged here—from Du Bois’s “double consciousness” to Butler’s anti-imperialism—would fuel the struggles of the century to come.

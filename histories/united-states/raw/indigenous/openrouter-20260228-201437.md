### The Indigenous Ethical Foundations of the United States

The ethical traditions of Indigenous peoples in what is now the United States form the foundational layer of moral thought in this land—not as "pre-history," but as living traditions that continue to shape American identity and values. Below is a detailed tracing of these traditions, rooted in specific legal, philosophical, and kinship systems.

### 1. **The Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa)**
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy’s Great Law of Peace is one of the oldest participatory democracies in the world, dating back to the 12th century. Its ethical architecture includes:

- **Clan Mothers as Moral Guardians:** Clan mothers select and remove chiefs, ensuring leadership aligns with communal well-being (Article 29, Great Law).
- **Seventh Generation Principle:** Decisions must consider their impact seven generations into the future, embedding intergenerational care into governance.
- **The Tree of Peace:** A symbol of unity and justice, with roots extending to all nations who adopt the Great Law.
- **Condolence Ceremony:** A ritual of reconciliation and renewal, ensuring harmony after conflict.

The influence of the Haudenosaunee on the U.S. Constitution is well-documented. As noted in *H. Con. Res. 331* (1988), Benjamin Franklin and other founders studied Haudenosaunee governance principles, which emphasized federalism, checks and balances, and participatory democracy.

### 2. **Cherokee Ethical Traditions**
The Cherokee concept of **duyuktv** (the right way/justice) governs personal behavior and communal harmony. Key traditions include:

- **Beloved Women:** Respected female leaders like Nancy Ward acted as moral arbiters and peacemakers, ensuring balance between clans and nations.
- **Cherokee Constitution of 1827:** Written before many European constitutions, it codified separation of powers and a bicameral legislature, reflecting Indigenous governance innovations.
- **Sequoyah’s Syllabary:** Created in 1821, it exemplifies intellectual sovereignty, enabling the Cherokee to preserve and transmit their ethical traditions in written form.

### 3. **Lakota Ethics**
Lakota morality centers on the **four cardinal virtues**—bravery, fortitude, generosity, and wisdom—and the kinship principle of **mitakuye oyasin** (all my relatives). This ethic recognizes the interconnectedness of all life, shaping Lakota stewardship of the land and sky.

- **Black Elk Speaks** (1932): In this oral testimony, Black Elk describes the sacred hoop of life, emphasizing moral responsibility to preserve balance and harmony.

### 4. **Navajo (Dine) Ethics**
The Navajo concept of **hozho** (beauty, balance, harmony) underpins their ethical system. Key elements include:

- **Hozhooji Naat’aanii (Peacemaking):** A restorative justice tradition that seeks to heal rather than punish, emphasizing reconciliation and restoring hozho.
- **The Long Walk (1864):** The forced removal of the Navajo by the U.S. government represents profound ethical harm, but it also highlights Navajo resilience and their enduring commitment to hozho.

### 5. **Pacific Northwest Traditions**
The **potlatch** ceremony, practiced by tribes like the Kwakwaka’wakw and Tlingit, exemplifies an ethical system centered on reciprocity and redistribution of wealth.

- **Potlatch Ban (1884-1951):** The Canadian and U.S. governments outlawed potlatch ceremonies, criminalizing Indigenous ethical practices and attempting to dismantle moral economies based on kinship and generosity.

### 6. **The Ethical Catastrophe of Colonization**
Colonization represents the foundational American ethical crisis—a rupture in Indigenous moral traditions and stewardship practices. Key moments include:

- **Trail of Tears (1838):** The forced removal of the Cherokee Nation exemplifies the violation of Indigenous sovereignty and ethical principles of care.
- **Dawes Act (1887):** By partitioning communal lands into individual plots, this act undermined Indigenous kinship systems and stewardship practices.
- **Boarding Schools:** Policies aimed at cultural genocide, such as Carlisle Indian Industrial School, sought to erase Indigenous ethical traditions under the slogan “kill the Indian, save the man.”
- **Ongoing Sovereignty Struggles:** Tribes like the Standing Rock Sioux continue to assert their moral responsibility to protect land and water, as seen in the Dakota Access Pipeline resistance (2016).

### 7. **Key Scholars**
These thinkers illuminate Indigenous ethical traditions and their relevance today:

- **Vine Deloria Jr.** (*God Is Red*, 1973): Argues that Indigenous spirituality and ethics offer a corrective to Western materialism and environmental destruction.
- **Robert Williams Jr.** (*Linking Arms Together*, 1997): Explores Indigenous legal traditions as models for contemporary justice.
- **Daniel Richter** (*Facing East from Indian Country*, 2001): Centers Indigenous perspectives in American history.
- **Ned Blackhawk** (*Violence Over the Land*, 2006): Analyzes the ethical impacts of colonization on Indigenous nations.

### Conclusion
The Indigenous ethical traditions of the United States are not relics of the past but living frameworks for care, stewardship, and justice. They expose the gap between American ideals and practices, challenging the nation to reckon with its foundational ethical crisis—the colonization of Indigenous peoples—and to restore balance through the principles of hozho, duyuktv, mitakuye oyasin, and the Seventh Generation. As Vine Deloria Jr. reminds us, Indigenous ethics are not just alternatives but necessities for a just and sustainable future.

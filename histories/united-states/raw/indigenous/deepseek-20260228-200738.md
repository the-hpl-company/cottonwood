# Indigenous Ethical Foundations of the Land Called the United States

## 1. Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa)
**Ethical Architecture:** The oldest continuously functioning participatory democracy in the Americas, dating to circa 1142 CE per oral history. Its ethical structure centers on peace, power, and righteousness.

- **Clan Mother Authority:** Article 15 establishes that "the women of every clan... shall have a Council Fire... in readiness for the selection of a new Chief." Clan mothers (Jigonsaseh's legacy) nominate, counsel, and can depose chiefs—embodying checks on power.
- **Seventh Generation Principle:** Embedded throughout, most explicitly in the requirement that leaders consider the impact of decisions on "the unborn of the future Nation" seven generations forward—a radical intergenerational ethics.
- **Tree of Peace:** The white pine under which weapons are buried, with roots extending to the four directions, inviting nations to follow the roots to shelter. This symbolizes peace through voluntary association.
- **Condolence Ceremony:** The ritual for mourning and installing new chiefs, ensuring continuity through grief—governance as healing practice.
- **Documented Influence:** U.S. House Concurrent Resolution 331 (1988) acknowledges "the confederation of the original 13 colonies into one republic was influenced by... the Iroquois Confederacy." Benjamin Franklin printed Iroquois treaty proceedings (1744), and the Albany Plan (1754) explicitly references Iroquois political structure.

## 2. Cherokee Ethical Traditions
**Duyuktv:** The "right way" or justice—a state of balance where all beings receive their due. Violations create *udugi* (trouble) requiring restoration.

- **Beloved Woman Tradition:** Nancy Ward (Nanyehi, c. 1738-1822) held the title *Ghigau* (Beloved Woman), granting her a voting seat on the General Council and authority over prisoners of war. She used this power to advocate for peace and adopt European weaving while resisting land cessions.
- **Cherokee Constitution of 1827:** Drafted at New Echota, establishing three branches of government, bill of rights, and disestablishing clan-based blood revenge—a synthesis of traditional law (like the 1808 written law code banning blood feud) and U.S. constitutional forms.
- **Sequoyah's Syllabary (1821):** A writing system created without alphabetic influence, leading to near-universal Cherokee literacy within years. The *Cherokee Phoenix* (1828) became the first Native American newspaper—intellectual sovereignty as ethical resistance.

## 3. Lakota Ethics
**The Four Cardinal Virtues:** *Woohitika* (bravery), *Canteyuke* (fortitude), *Wacantognaka* (generosity), *Woksape* (wisdom)—the ethical pillars of *tiospaye* (extended family) life.

- **Mitakuye Oyasin:** "All my relatives" or "we are all related." This prayer-ending phrase establishes an ethical universe of kinship extending beyond humans to animals, plants, and land. It demands reciprocity, not dominion.
- **Black Elk Speaks (1932):** As told to John Neihardt, the visionary's account provides ethical testimony: "The nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead." This laments the violation of the sacred hoop (*cangleska wakan*), the ethical-geographic order.

## 4. Navajo (Diné) Ethics
**Hozho:** The central concept translating as beauty, harmony, balance, blessedness. The ethical goal is to "walk in beauty," restoring *hozho* through right relationship.

- **Hozhooji Naat'aanii (Peacemaking):** A restorative justice system where a *naat'aanii* (peacemaker) facilitates dialogue to restore harmony rather than punish. The process aims for *hozho nahasdlii* (re-establishing beauty).
- **The Long Walk (1864-1868):** The U.S. military's forced removal to Bosque Redondo (Hwéeldi) violated *hozho* through starvation, disease, and displacement. The 1868 Treaty allowed return, but the ethical aftermath included the "scorched earth" policy (Kit Carson's destruction of peach orchards and livestock) as deliberate ecological harm to destroy Navajo lifeways.

## 5. Pacific Northwest Traditions
**The Potlatch:** A complex ethical institution among Kwakwaka'wakw, Haida, Tlingit, and others, where wealth redistribution validates status, settles disputes, and maintains balance.

- **Moral Obligation:** Chiefs accumulated goods not for hoarding but for giving—the more given, the greater prestige. This created reciprocal obligations and prevented wealth concentration.
- **Government Ban:** Canada's Indian Act (1884) and U.S. assimilation policies criminalized potlatch as "wasteful" and "savage." The infamous 1921 Kwakwaka'wakw potlatch at Village Island led to arrests and confiscation of sacred regalia—an intentional attack on ethical-economic systems.

## 6. The Ethical Catastrophe of Colonization
This is not passive history but the **foundational American ethical crisis**—the collision between indigenous relational ethics and settler extractive paradigms.

- **Trail of Tears (1838-1839):** Despite Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) recognizing tribal sovereignty, and Worcester v. Georgia (1832) affirming Cherokee jurisdiction, President Jackson enforced the Indian Removal Act (1830). Over 4,000 Cherokee died during removal—a violation of the Treaty of New Echota (1835), signed by a minority faction.
- **Dawes Act (1887):** Forced allotment divided communal lands into individual parcels, destroying collective stewardship ethics. "Surplus" lands (90 million acres) opened to settlers.
- **Boarding Schools:** Captain Richard H. Pratt's Carlisle Indian School (1879) motto: "Kill the Indian, save the man." Systematic cultural genocide through child removal, documented in the 1928 Meriam Report.
- **Ongoing Sovereignty:** The American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978), Indian Child Welfare Act (1978), and McGirt v. Oklahoma (2020) represent ongoing ethical-legal struggles.

## 7. Key Scholars
- **Vine Deloria Jr.** (*God Is Red*, 1973): Argued indigenous spatial/land-based religion is ethically superior to European time-based salvation history.
- **Robert A. Williams Jr.** (*Linking Arms Together*, 1997): Analyzed treaty-making as covenant chain tradition rooted in indigenous diplomatic ethics.
- **Daniel K. Richter** (*Facing East from Indian Country*, 2001): Recentered indigenous perspectives in early American history.
- **Ned Blackhawk** (*Violence Over the Land*, 2006): Documented how violence shaped colonial encounters and indigenous survival.

**Ethical Legacy:** These traditions establish the first layer of American ethical thought: **relationality over individualism, reciprocity over extraction, restorative justice over punitive justice, and intergenerational responsibility over immediate gain.** The United States would forever oscillate between rejecting and unconsciously echoing these foundations—the original gap between its borrowed ideals and its colonial practices.

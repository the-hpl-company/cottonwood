# Indigenous Ethical Foundations of the Land Now Called the United States

## 1. Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa)
**Ethical Architecture:** The Great Law, orally codified circa 1142-1450 CE, establishes the world's oldest continuous participatory democracy. Its ethical core is **Skén:nen** (peace), **Karihwí:io** (righteousness), and **Kasátstensera** (power).

**Specific Provisions:**
- **Clan Mother Authority:** Clan Mothers (Jigonsaseh lineage) nominate, counsel, and can depose **Royaneh** (chiefs) based on character and service. This embodies care through accountable leadership.
- **Seventh Generation Principle:** Article 28: "In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation." This extends ethical obligation temporally beyond immediate gain.
- **Tree of Peace:** The white pine symbolizes peace, with weapons buried beneath. The Eagle atop warns of danger—protection as collective vigilance.
- **Condolence Ceremony:** The **Hiawatha Belt** (five nations: Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk) uses wampum to heal grief and restore balance after leader deaths.

**Documented Influence:** U.S. Congress **H. Con. Res. 331 (1988)** acknowledges: "The confederation of the original thirteen colonies into one republic was influenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy." Benjamin Franklin's **"Albany Plan of Union" (1754)** explicitly references Iroquois federal structure. The U.S. Constitution's federalism, impeachment (chiefs' removal), and bicameral legislature (Council of Elders/People) bear Haudenosaunee imprint.

## 2. Cherokee Ethical Traditions
**Duyuktv:** The "right way"—a state of balance where humans act with justice, humility, and reciprocity toward all beings. Violations cause **udugi** (harmful energy).

**Beloved Woman Tradition:** **Nanye-hi** (Nancy Ward), **Ghigau** (Beloved Woman), held a voting seat on the General Council and power over war captives. In 1781, she warned settlers of attack, embodying the ethic that even enemies deserve protection when seeking peace.

**Cherokee Constitution of 1827:** Predates Belgium's (1831) and Germany's (1871) constitutions. Article I establishes three branches; Article II guarantees freedom of religion; Article III creates representative districts. It explicitly outlaws **enslavement of Cherokee citizens**—a moral stance the U.S. Constitution avoided.

**Sequoyah's Syllabary (1821):** 85 characters enabling near-universal Cherokee literacy within years. An act of **intellectual sovereignty**, allowing the *Cherokee Phoenix* (1828) to publish laws and treaties, asserting ethical self-definition against removal pressures.

## 3. Lakota Ethics
**The Four Cardinal Virtues:**
- **Wóohitika** (Bravery): Defense of the vulnerable, not aggression.
- **Wówacintanka** (Fortitude): Enduring suffering to maintain community.
- **Wacantognaka** (Generosity): The highest virtue—wealth exists for redistribution.
- **Wóksape** (Wisdom): Knowledge tempered by humility.

**Mitakuye Oyasin:** "All my relatives." From **Lakol Wicoh'an** (Lakota way of life), this phrase concludes prayers, recognizing kinship with all creation. It ethically obligates care for humans, animals, plants, and land as relatives.

**Black Elk Speaks (1932):** As told to John Neihardt, **Heȟáka Sápa's** vision describes the **sacred hoop** of the nation broken by colonization: "The nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead." An ethical testimony to catastrophic harm.

## 4. Navajo (Diné) Ethics
**Hozho:** The central concept—beauty, balance, harmony, and order. **Sa'ah Naaghai Bik'eh Hozhoon** describes the journey to harmonious living. Illness and wrongdoing are **hóchxǫ́ǫ́** (disorder), cured through restoration.

**Hozhooji Naat'aanii (Peacemaking):** A restorative justice system where **Naat'áanii** (peacemakers) facilitate dialogue to restore **hozho**. Unlike adversarial courts, it seeks consensus and healing. The 2002 Navajo Nation Law Code formally recognizes this tradition.

**The Long Walk (1864-1868):** 8,000 Diné forced 300 miles to **Hwéeldi** (Bosque Redondo). 2,500 died. The 1868 **Treaty of Bosque Redondo** allowed return, but imposed individual land allotments—an ethical violation of **K'é** (kinship/clan system). Diné ethics transformed trauma into the **"Beauty Way"** ceremony, restoring hozho.

## 5. Pacific Northwest Traditions
**Potlatch (Kwakwaka'wakw: "paɬa't'ł"):** A ceremonial redistribution of wealth where chiefs give away possessions to affirm status through generosity, not accumulation. It embodies the ethical obligation: wealth creates debt to community.

**Suppression as Ethical Destruction:** Canada's **Indian Act (1884)** and U.S. federal agents (following **Code of Indian Offenses, 1883**) criminalized potlatch. In **U.S. v. Clapox (1888)**, courts upheld banning "heathenish rites." The **Kwakwaka'wakw at Alert Bay (1921)** saw 45 arrested for potlatching; regalia confiscated. This was intentional destruction of an ethical economy based on reciprocity.

## 6. The Ethical Catastrophe of Colonization
**Trail of Tears (1838-1839):** Despite **Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831)** recognizing tribal sovereignty, and **Worcester v. Georgia (1832)** affirming treaty rights, President Jackson enforced the **Indian Removal Act (1830)**. 4,000 Cherokee died—a breach of the **Treaty of Hopewell (1785)** and **Treaty of New Echota (1835)**.

**Dawes Act (1887):** Broke collective landholdings into 160-acre allotments, stripping 90 million acres from tribes. Senator Henry Dawes declared Indians lacked "selfishness"—the ethical virtue of generosity weaponized to justify theft.

**Boarding Schools:** Captain Richard H. Pratt's **Carlisle Indian School (1879)** motto: "Kill the Indian, save the man." The **"Mourning Laws"** forbade speaking Native languages, wearing traditional clothes, or practicing ceremonies—ethical genocide.

**Ongoing Sovereignty Struggle:** **United States v. Wheeler (1978)** affirmed inherent tribal sovereignty; **Indian Child Welfare Act (1978)** protected kinship ethics; yet **McGirt v. Oklahoma (2020)** remains contested. The ethical crisis persists: how can a nation founded on liberty systematically violate indigenous sovereignty?

## 7. Key Scholars
- **Vine Deloria Jr.** (*Custer Died for Your Sins*, 1969; *God Is Red*, 1973): Argued tribal religions are place-based ethical systems, contrasting with Christianity's historical linearity. "American Indians hold their lands—places—as having the highest possible meaning."
- **Robert A. Williams Jr.** (*Linking Arms Together*, 1997): Analyzed treaty ceremonies as covenant chains—indigenous diplomatic ethics of mutual respect, later betrayed.
- **Daniel Richter** (*Facing East from Indian Country*, 2001): Re-centered narrative east from Indian country, showing how indigenous ethical frameworks shaped early encounters.
- **Ned Blackhawk** (*Violence over the Land*, 2006): Documented how Shoshone and Ute ethics adapted to Spanish and American violence, resisting reduction to victimhood.

**Ethical Throughline:** Indigenous traditions center **relational accountability**—to ancestors, descendants, all beings, and the land itself. The American ethical crisis begins with the violation of these covenants, creating what historian **Jean M. O'Brien** terms "firsting and lasting"—the myth that Indians vanished, erasing living ethical traditions. Yet as **Lakota scholar Nick Estes** (*Our History Is the Future*, 2019) notes, the **#NoDAPL movement at Standing Rock (2016)** invoked **Mni Wiconi** (Water Is Life)—a 21st-century expression of mitakuye oyasin, proving these ethical foundations endure.

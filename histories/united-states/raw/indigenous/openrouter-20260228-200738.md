The indigenous ethical traditions of the land now called the United States form the foundational moral and intellectual layer of this continent, not a "pre-history" but a living, continuous framework of governance, justice, and relationality. These traditions were systematically disrupted by colonization, but they endure as ethical counterpoints to the American project. Below is a traced intellectual and ethical foundation:

---

### 1. **Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa)**  
The Great Law of Peace, orally codified centuries before European contact, establishes the ethical architecture of participatory democracy. Key principles include:  
- **Clan Mothers' Authority**: Clan mothers select and remove chiefs (Articles 17, 19) based on character and wisdom, ensuring leadership reflects community values.  
- **Seventh Generation Principle**: Decisions must consider their impact seven generations into the future (Article 93), embedding ecological and intergenerational ethics.  
- **Tree of Peace**: The Great Law describes planting a white pine under which weapons are buried, symbolizing unity and peace among nations.  
- **Condolence Ceremony**: A ritual for grieving and restoring harmony, ensuring conflict resolution prioritizes healing.  

The influence of these principles on the U.S. Constitution is documented in **H. Con. Res. 331 (1988)**, which acknowledges the Great Law's role in shaping American federalism. Benjamin Franklin and other Founders studied Haudenosaunee governance, particularly their confederacy model.

### 2. **Cherokee Ethical Traditions**  
The Cherokee concept of *duyuktv* (the right way/justice) emphasizes balance, reciprocity, and respect for all life. Key institutions include:  
- **The Beloved Woman**: A position of moral authority, exemplified by figures like Nancy Ward (Nanyehi), who mediated conflicts and advocated for peace during colonial encroachment.  
- **Cherokee Constitution (1827)**: Predating many European constitutions, this document codified a tripartite government with separated powers, blending traditional governance with modern structures.  
- **Sequoyah’s Syllabary**: Created in 1821, this writing system asserted intellectual sovereignty, enabling the Cherokee to preserve their language and traditions despite colonization.

### 3. **Lakota Ethics**  
Lakota ethics center on the four cardinal virtues: bravery (*Wóohitike*), fortitude (*Wówacintanka*), generosity (*Čhaŋtéšiča*), and wisdom (*Wóksape*). The concept of *mitakuye oyasin* ("all my relatives") underpins an ethical framework of interconnectedness.  
- **Black Elk Speaks (1932)**: Black Elk’s teachings, transcribed by John Neihardt, articulate Lakota cosmology and ethics, emphasizing harmony with the natural world and spiritual responsibility.

### 4. **Navajo (Dine) Ethics**  
The Dine concept of *hozho* (beauty, balance, harmony) governs personal and communal life. Key traditions include:  
- **Hozhooji Naat’aanii (Peacemaking)**: A restorative justice process that seeks to restore harmony rather than punish.  
- **The Long Walk (1864)**: The forced removal of the Navajo to Bosque Redondo was a profound ethical violation, but their return and rebuilding reaffirmed resilience and commitment to *hozho*.

### 5. **Pacific Northwest Traditions**  
The potlatch, a ceremonial redistribution of wealth, embodies the ethical obligation to care for the community. The **Canadian Potlatch Law (1884)** and U.S. bans targeted this tradition, seeking to dismantle indigenous moral economies. Despite suppression, potlatch persists as an act of resistance.

### 6. **The Ethical Catastrophe of Colonization**  
Colonization was not merely an event but an ongoing ethical crisis rooted in dehumanization and displacement:  
- **Trail of Tears (1838-1839)**: The forced removal of Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, and other nations violated treaties and moral principles.  
- **Dawes Act (1887)**: Land allotment policies destroyed communal landholding traditions, fragmenting indigenous societies.  
- **Boarding Schools**: The slogan "kill the Indian, save the man" encapsulated the genocidal intent to erase indigenous culture and ethics.  
- **Ongoing Sovereignty Struggles**: Legal battles, such as those over the **Indian Child Welfare Act (1978)**, continue to affirm indigenous rights.

### 7. **Key Scholars**  
- **Vine Deloria Jr.** (*God Is Red*, 1973): Explores indigenous spirituality as an ethical alternative to Western paradigms.  
- **Robert Williams Jr.** (*Linking Arms Together*, 1997): Analyzes indigenous legal traditions and their relevance to modern jurisprudence.  
- **Daniel Richter** (*Facing East from Indian Country*, 2001): Re-centers indigenous perspectives in American history.  
- **Ned Blackhawk** (*Violence Over the Land*, 2006): Documents the ethical violences of colonization and indigenous resilience.

Indigenous ethical traditions are not relics but living frameworks that challenge the contradictions of the American project. They offer a foundation for reimagining harm, care, and stewardship in a fractured world.

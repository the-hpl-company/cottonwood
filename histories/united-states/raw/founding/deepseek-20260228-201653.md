# American Ethical Thought, 1607–1830: The Founding Contradiction

## 1. Puritan Ethics: Covenant and Exclusion
**John Winthrop’s “A Model of Christian Charity” (1630)** establishes the foundational American ethical metaphor: the **“city upon a hill.”** This is a **covenant theology**—a collective agreement with God requiring mutual care (“we must be knit together in this work as one man”) and strict social hierarchy. The **ethics of the elect** created a moral binary: visible saints versus the unregenerate, justifying surveillance and control.

The **Salem witch trials (1692)** expose the ethical failure of this framework: spectral evidence, coerced confession, and the execution of 20 individuals revealed how covenantal unity could become persecutory frenzy. **Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” (1741)** recalibrated Puritan ethics through revivalism, emphasizing individual conversion and divine sovereignty, but maintained an exclusionary moral order.

## 2. The Declaration of Independence: The Contradiction Embodied
**July 4, 1776:** The Declaration’s proposition that **“all men are created equal”** and endowed with **“unalienable Rights”** is the nation’s core ethical statement. Its author, **Thomas Jefferson**, held over 600 people in bondage. This was not merely hypocrisy but a **structured philosophical contradiction**: Jefferson’s *Notes on the State of Virginia* (1785) reveals his belief in Black inferiority, even as he condemned slavery as a “moral depravity.”

The enslaved people in Monticello, notably **Sally Hemings** (whose perspective is recovered by **Annette Gordon-Reed**), understood the Declaration’s language as a **betrayed promise**. As historian **Edmund Morgan** argues in *American Slavery, American Freedom* (1975), the very liberty of the white republic was built on the subjugation of Black bodies.

## 3. The Constitutional Bargain: Encoding Slavery
The **U.S. Constitution (1787)** is a dual ethical document. It establishes a **republican framework for limited government** (Articles I–III) while embedding slavery through:
- **Article I, Section 2:** The **Three-Fifths Clause**, counting enslaved people as 3/5 of a person for representation, amplifying slaveholding power.
- **Article I, Section 9:** Prohibiting congressional abolition of the **Atlantic slave trade** until 1808.
- **Article IV, Section 2:** The **Fugitive Slave Clause**, requiring return of escaped persons.

**The Federalist Papers (1787–88)** provide the ethical argument for this compromise. **Federalist No. 10** (Madison) warns of faction but sidesteps slavery; **Federalist No. 51** (Madison) champions checks and balances but accepts slavery as the price of union.

## 4. The Bill of Rights: Limited Protections
Ratified **1791**, the first ten amendments establish an **ethical architecture of negative liberty**—restraining federal power to protect conscience (First), property (Fourth, Fifth), and due process (Fifth, Sixth). Its **failures are stark**: it protected slaveholders’ property in humans, did not apply to states (per *Barron v. Baltimore*, 1833), and excluded Native nations entirely. The **Second Amendment’s** “well-regulated militia” was partly intended to control slave revolts.

## 5. Hamilton vs. Jefferson: Competing Ethical Visions
- **Alexander Hamilton:** *Report on Manufactures* (1791) and advocacy for the **First Bank of the United States (1791)** championed a **meritocratic, commercial republic** with a strong central state. His ethics were of **“honest graft”**—using state power to build enduring institutions for national prosperity.
- **Thomas Jefferson:** *First Inaugural Address* (1801) called for “wise and frugal Government” and an **agrarian republic of yeomen farmers**. His ethics prized **popular sovereignty and states’ rights**, yet his vision depended on enslaved labor and westward expansion onto Indigenous lands.

This debate framed the central tension between **collective economic development** and **individualist liberty**—both built on exploited labor.

## 6. The Abolition Movement: The First Systematic Ethical Critique
Organized abolitionism emerged in the 1830s, but earlier voices like **Benjamin Lay** and **Quaker petitions** laid groundwork. Key texts:
- **David Walker’s *Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World* (1829)**: A radical demand for justice.
- **William Lloyd Garrison’s *The Liberator* (1831)**: “I will be harsh as truth… I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch—AND I WILL BE HEARD.”
- **Frederick Douglass’s *Narrative* (1845)** and **“What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” (1852)**: “This Fourth of July is *yours*, not *mine*… Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.”
- **Harriet Beecher Stowe’s *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* (1852)**: Mobilized sentimental ethics against slavery.

The movement split over **moral suasion vs. political action**, culminating in **John Brown’s raid (1859)**, which posed the ethical question: is violence justified to overthrow a violent system?

## 7. Indigenous Removal: Liberty as Dispossession
The **Indian Removal Act (1830)** signed by Andrew Jackson forced the expulsion of Southeastern nations. The ethical justification was **Jeffersonian agrarianism**—land must be “improved” by yeomen farmers. In **Worcester v. Georgia (1832)**, Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that Cherokee nation possessed sovereign rights, but Jackson ignored the decision, leading to the **Trail of Tears (1838–39)**. American ethical thought **narrated expansion as “progress,”** casting Native peoples as obstacles to liberty’s spread—a genocide enabled by **rhetorical erasure**.

## 8. Scholarly Frameworks
- **Gordon Wood (*The Radicalism of the American Revolution*, 1992)**: Highlights the transformative, egalitarian ethos of the Revolution, yet underplays its racial exclusivity.
- **Edmund Morgan (*American Slavery, American Freedom*, 1975)**: Argues that American republicanism was *founded* on slavery: “The rise of liberty and equality in America… was accompanied by the rise of slavery.”
- **David Brion Davis (*The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution*, 1975)**: Traces how Enlightenment ideals coexisted with and ultimately challenged slavery.
- **Annette Gordon-Reed (*The Hemingses of Monticello*, 2008)**: Recovers the lived experience of the contradiction, showing how enslaved people navigated and resisted the system.

---

**Core Thesis:** The American ethical tradition from 1607–1830 is defined by the **productive tension between professed ideals and systemic violence**. The “city upon a hill” was built on stolen land with stolen labor. This gap—between the Declaration’s equality and the Constitution’s protections for slavery, between Puritan covenant and witch trials, between Jeffersonian liberty and Indigenous removal—is not an aberration but the **central drama of American moral thought**. The abolitionist movement emerges as the first sustained effort to force the nation to close that gap, setting the pattern for all subsequent ethical struggles.

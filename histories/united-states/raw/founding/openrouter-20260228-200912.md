**American Ethical Thought from Colonial Settlement through the Early Republic (1607-1830)**

The ethical thought of colonial and early republican America is defined by a profound contradiction: the simultaneous articulation of lofty ideals of liberty and equality alongside the practice of systemic violence against enslaved Africans, Indigenous peoples, and others. This tension—between aspiration and reality—shapes the American ethical tradition.

**1. Puritan Ethics: Covenant Theology and the City Upon a Hill**  
- **John Winthrop’s "A Model of Christian Charity" (1630)** articulated the Puritan vision of a "city upon a hill," a moral exemplar to the world. This was grounded in **covenant theology**, which saw society as bound by a mutual covenant with God. Ethics flowed from divine law, and the **elect** were understood as morally superior.  
- Yet the **Salem Witch Trials (1692-1693)** exposed the darker side of Puritan ethics: the persecution of the marginalized, particularly women, under the guise of divine justice.  
- **Jonathan Edwards**, in *Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God* (1741), emphasized the ethical urgency of revivalism, urging repentance and moral transformation through fear of divine wrath.

**2. The Declaration of Independence: Equality and Hypocrisy**  
- The **Declaration of Independence (1776)**, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, proclaimed that "all men are created equal" and endowed with "unalienable rights." Yet Jefferson held over 600 enslaved people at Monticello.  
- Enslaved individuals like **Sally Hemings** (Jefferson’s enslaved concubine) understood the Declaration as a hollow promise. **Frederick Douglass**, in *What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?* (1852), later called the Declaration "a sham" for enslaved people.  
- This contradiction reflects the gap between American ideals and practice, a theme central to **Edmund Morgan’s** *American Slavery, American Freedom* (1975).

**3. The Constitutional Bargain: Liberty and Slavery**  
- The U.S. Constitution (1787) encoded both liberty and slavery. The **Three-Fifths Compromise** (Article I, Section 2) counted enslaved people as three-fifths of a person for representation. The **Fugitive Slave Clause** (Article IV, Section 2) required the return of escaped enslaved people, and the **slave trade provision** (Article I, Section 9) delayed abolition of the international slave trade until 1808.  
- **The Federalist Papers** (1787-1788), especially **Federalist 10** (on factions) and **Federalist 51** (on checks and balances), framed the Constitution as a moral safeguard against tyranny, yet failed to address the tyranny of slavery.

---

**4. The Bill of Rights: Ethical Protections and Omissions**  
- The **Bill of Rights** (1791) protected individual liberties, including freedom of speech (First Amendment), the right to bear arms (Second Amendment), and protections against unreasonable searches (Fourth Amendment).  
- Yet it failed to address slavery, Indigenous sovereignty, or women’s rights, leaving glaring ethical gaps. Its focus on **limited government** reflected a distrust of centralized power, a theme central to early republican thought.

---

**5. Hamilton vs. Jefferson: Competing Ethical Visions**  
- **Alexander Hamilton** championed a strong federal government, central banking (*Report on Public Credit*, 1790), and industrial capitalism. His vision of "honest graft" sought to build institutions that would secure national prosperity.  
- **Thomas Jefferson** advocated for an agrarian republic, states’ rights, and popular sovereignty (*Notes on the State of Virginia*, 1785). His vision, though rooted in liberty, was dependent on enslaved labor.  
- Their debate embodied the tension between centralized power and local autonomy, a defining feature of American ethics.

**6. The Abolition Movement: America’s First Systematic Ethical Critique**  
- Early abolitionists like **William Lloyd Garrison** (*The Liberator*, 1831) and **Frederick Douglass** (*Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass*, 1845) exposed the moral bankruptcy of slavery.  
- **Harriet Beecher Stowe’s** *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* (1852) galvanized public sentiment against slavery, while **John Brown’s** raid on Harpers Ferry (1859) raised questions about the ethics of violent resistance.  
- Abolitionism forced America to confront its founding contradiction.

---

**7. Indigenous Removal: Liberty alongside Genocide**  
- The **Indian Removal Act (1830)**, signed by Andrew Jackson, forcibly relocated Indigenous nations from their ancestral lands.  
- Chief Justice **John Marshall’s** decision in *Worcester v. Georgia* (1832) affirmed Indigenous sovereignty but was ignored by Jackson, leading to the **Trail of Tears** (1838-1839), during which thousands of Cherokee died.  
- This policy reflected the ethical failure to reconcile expansion with Indigenous rights.

---

**8. Key Scholars**  
- **Gordon Wood** (*The Radicalism of the American Revolution*, 1992) emphasizes the transformative power of revolutionary ideals.  
- **Edmund Morgan** (*American Slavery, American Freedom*, 1975) explores how liberty for white Americans was built on the backs of enslaved Africans.  
- **Annette Gordon-Reed** (*The Hemingses of Monticello*, 2008) uncovers the lives of enslaved individuals within Jefferson’s household, exposing the personal dimensions of systemic injustice.

This period reveals the central tension of American ethics: the gap between ideals of liberty and equality and the reality of systemic violence. This tension remains the defining feature of the American ethical tradition.

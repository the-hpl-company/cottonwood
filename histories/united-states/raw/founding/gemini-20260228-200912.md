Okay, here's a survey of American ethical thought from colonial settlement through the early republic (1607-1830), with emphasis on the fundamental contradiction between its ideals and realities.

**1. Puritan Ethics: Covenant, Election, and Contradiction**

The first enduring European settlements in what would become the United States were driven by religious ideals, primarily those of Puritanism. John Winthrop's "A Model of Christian Charity" (1630) outlined the vision of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a "city upon a hill," a beacon of righteousness for the world. This vision rested on a "covenant" theology, where God entered into a binding agreement with the community. Success was interpreted as divine favor, and failure as a sign of broken covenant.

*   **Ethical Framework:** Puritan ethics emphasized communal responsibility, hard work, and strict moral conduct, guided by scripture as interpreted by the elect.
*   **The Ethics of the Elect:** The belief in predestination created a social hierarchy, where the "elect" (those chosen by God for salvation) held positions of authority. This could lead to a sense of entitlement and exclusion.
*   **Ethical Failure: The Salem Witch Trials (1692-93):** The witch trials exposed the dark side of Puritan zealotry, demonstrating how easily fear, suspicion, and social anxieties could lead to injustice and persecution.

Jonathan Edwards, a leading figure in the Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s, sought to revive Puritan fervor with his fiery sermons, most famously "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" (1741). Edwards's emphasis on personal conversion and the overwhelming power of God contributed to a renewed sense of religious devotion, but also reinforced the strict moral code of Puritanism.

**2. The Declaration of Independence: A Promise and a Paradox (1776)**

The Declaration of Independence, penned by Thomas Jefferson, is arguably the foundational ethical document of the United States.

*   **Ethical Declaration:** The assertion that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" is a powerful statement of human dignity and natural rights.
*   **The Contradiction:** Jefferson, the author of these words, was a slaveholder. This contradiction—the simultaneous proclamation of liberty and the practice of slavery—is the central ethical tension in American history.
*   **Jefferson's Meaning:** Historians debate Jefferson's intent. Some argue he meant "all white men," while others believe he intended a more universal principle but lacked the political will to abolish slavery. Annette Gordon-Reed's work demonstrates the hypocrisy of Jefferson's personal life and the human cost of his choices.
*   **The Enslaved People's Understanding:** For enslaved people, the Declaration was a constant reminder of the hypocrisy of their oppressors. It fueled their hopes for freedom and provided a moral basis for resistance. As Frederick Douglass would later declare in "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" (1852), the Declaration was a "scandal" to the American conscience.

**3. The Constitutional Bargain: Encoding Liberty and Slavery (1787)**

The U.S. Constitution, drafted in 1787, attempted to create a more perfect union, but it did so by compromising on the issue of slavery.

*   **The Three-Fifths Compromise (Article I, Section 2):** Ensured that enslaved people would be counted as three-fifths of a person for purposes of representation in Congress, giving slave states disproportionate political power.
*   **The Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2):** Required the return of runaway slaves to their owners, effectively nationalizing slavery.
*   **The Slave Trade Provision (Article I, Section 9):** Prevented Congress from banning the importation of slaves until 1808.
*   **Liberty and Slavery:** Edmund Morgan, in *American Slavery, American Freedom* (1975), argues that slavery and freedom were intertwined in early American history. The economic prosperity of the colonies, particularly in the South, was built on slave labor, and the concept of freedom was often defined in opposition to the enslaved.
*   **The Federalist Papers:** *The Federalist Papers*, especially Federalist No. 10 (James Madison) and Federalist No. 51 (James Madison or Alexander Hamilton), sought to address ethical concerns about factionalism and the potential for tyranny. Madison argued that a large republic with diverse interests could prevent any one faction from dominating, but this argument largely ignored the fundamental faction of slaveholders.

**4. The Bill of Rights: Limited Protections (1791)**

The Bill of Rights, added to the Constitution in 1791, guarantees certain fundamental rights.

*   **Protections:** Freedom of speech, religion, the press, the right to bear arms, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to due process and a fair trial.
*   **Failures:** The Bill of Rights did not apply to enslaved people, Native Americans, or women. It also lacked explicit protections against discrimination based on race or gender.
*   **Limited Government:** The Bill of Rights reflects the ethical architecture of limited government, designed to protect individual liberty from government intrusion. However, this framework also limited the government's ability to address social and economic inequalities.

**5. Hamilton vs. Jefferson: Two Ethical Visions**

Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson represented two distinct ethical visions for the new nation.

*   **Hamilton:** Advocated for a strong central government, a national bank, and a diversified economy based on manufacturing and commerce. He believed in a more elitist form of government, led by educated and experienced leaders. The establishment of the First Bank of the United States in 1791, while controversial, was seen by Hamilton as a necessary step for economic stability.
*   **Jefferson:** Championed an agrarian republic, states' rights, and popular sovereignty. He feared the concentration of power in the hands of the federal government and believed in the virtue of the yeoman farmer. Jefferson's vision was more democratic but also relied on the continuation of slavery.

**6. The Abolition Movement: An Ethical Critique**

The abolition movement emerged as the most systematic ethical critique of American society.

*   **Early Voices:** Figures like Anthony Benezet and John Woolman, both Quakers, condemned slavery on religious grounds as early as the 18th century.
*   **Key Figures:** William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Sojourner Truth.
*   **Frederick Douglass:** His *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave* (1845) exposed the brutality of slavery and the hypocrisy of American ideals. "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" (1852) remains a powerful indictment of American injustice.
*   **Harriet Beecher Stowe:** Her novel *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852) brought the horrors of slavery to a wider audience and fueled the abolitionist cause.
*   **Violent vs. Nonviolent Resistance:** The movement was divided over the issue of violence. Figures like John Brown (raid on Harpers Ferry, 1859) believed that violence was necessary to overthrow slavery, while others, like Garrison, advocated for nonviolent resistance.

**7. Indigenous Removal and Expansion: Genocide and Liberty**

The westward expansion of the United States was accompanied by the displacement and dispossession of Native American tribes.

*   **Indian Removal Act (1830):** Signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, authorized the forced removal of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the southeastern United States to west of the Mississippi River.
*   **Worcester v. Georgia (1832):** The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that the Cherokee Nation was a sovereign entity and that the state of Georgia had no authority over it. However, President Jackson refused to enforce the ruling.
*   **Trail of Tears:** The forced removal of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Chickasaw nations, resulting in the deaths of thousands.
*   **Ethical Justifications:** American ethical thought often justified this genocide through ideas of racial superiority, manifest destiny, and the belief that Native Americans were obstacles to progress. These justifications reveal the deeply ingrained racism and ethnocentrism that shaped American history.

**Key Scholars**

*   **Gordon Wood:** Explores the radicalism of the American Revolution and the transformation of American political thought in *The Radicalism of the American Revolution* (1991).
*   **Edmund Morgan:** Argues that slavery and freedom were intertwined in early American history in *American Slavery, American Freedom* (1975).
*   **David Brion Davis:** Analyzes the development of anti-slavery thought in *The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture* (1988).
*   **Annette Gordon-Reed:** Sheds light on the complexities of Thomas Jefferson's life and his relationship with Sally Hemings in *Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy* (1997) and *The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family* (2008).

The American ethical tradition during this period is thus defined by the gap between its ideals and its practice. The simultaneous embrace of liberty and slavery, the promise of equality alongside the reality of oppression, and the justification of expansion through the dehumanization of Native Americans created a deeply contradictory and morally compromised national identity. This contradiction continues to shape American ethical debates to this day.

The ethical history of the United States from colonial settlement through the early republic is defined by a foundational contradiction: the simultaneous articulation of liberty and equality alongside systems of enslavement, dispossession, and exclusion. This tension between ideals and practice shapes the American moral tradition.

### 1. Puritan Ethics: Covenant Theology and the Ethics of the Elect  
The Puritan ethical framework was rooted in *covenant theology*, which emphasized a reciprocal relationship between God and humanity. John Winthrop’s 1630 sermon *"A Model of Christian Charity"* introduced the metaphor of the "city upon a hill," envisioning America as a moral exemplar grounded in communal responsibility. Puritans believed in a covenant with God, where social and moral order were paramount.  

However, this ethical framework was exclusionary. The concept of the "elect" — those predestined for salvation — created a stratified moral hierarchy. The Salem witch trials (1692) exemplify the failure of this system, as fear and moral panic led to the execution of 19 individuals, revealing the dangers of ideological rigidity and collective hysteria.  

Jonathan Edwards’s 1741 sermon *"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"* redefined Puritan ethics during the Great Awakening, emphasizing individual conversion and moral accountability. Yet, revivalism coexisted with profound moral blind spots, including the Puritan justification of land dispossession as a divine mandate.

### 2. The Declaration of Independence: Equality as Contradiction  
The Declaration of Independence (1776), authored by Thomas Jefferson, declared that "all men are created equal" and endowed with "unalienable Rights." This claim was revolutionary, asserting a universal moral principle. Yet, Jefferson, a slaveholder, embodied the hypocrisy of this assertion.  

Jefferson’s philosophical writings, such as *Notes on the State of Virginia* (1785), reveal his struggle to reconcile Enlightenment ideals with his reliance on enslaved labor. Meanwhile, enslaved individuals like Sally Hemings, Jefferson’s enslaved companion, and Jupiter Evans, his enslaved manservant, understood this contradiction firsthand. Frederick Douglass would later critique this hypocrisy in his 1852 speech, *"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"*, exposing the gap between America’s ideals and its practices.

### 3. The Constitutional Bargain: Liberty and Slavery  
The U.S. Constitution (1787) encoded both liberty and slavery, reflecting the young nation’s moral compromise. The Three-Fifths Compromise (Article I, Section 2) counted enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a person for representation, institutionalizing their dehumanization. The Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2) mandated the return of escaped enslaved persons, and the Slave Trade Clause (Article I, Section 9) delayed the abolition of the international slave trade until 1808.  

Alexander Hamilton and James Madison defended the Constitution in *The Federalist Papers* (1787-1788), presenting it as a pragmatic solution to factionalism (Federalist 10) and a system of checks and balances (Federalist 51). Yet, this ethical framework accommodated slavery, exposing the limits of the Founders’ moral vision.

### 4. The Bill of Rights: Ethical Architecture of Limited Government  
The Bill of Rights (1791) established protections for individual liberties, such as freedom of speech (First Amendment) and protections against unreasonable searches (Fourth Amendment). However, it failed to address the rights of enslaved individuals, Native Americans, or women. The Tenth Amendment’s emphasis on states’ rights would later be used to justify slavery and segregation, illustrating the limitations of this ethical framework.

### 5. Hamilton vs. Jefferson: Competing Ethical Visions  
Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson articulated divergent ethical visions for the nation. Hamilton, in *The Report on Manufactures* (1791), advocated for industrialization, central banking, and a strong federal government, envisioning a modern, economically independent nation. Jefferson, in *The Notes on the State of Virginia* (1785), championed an agrarian republic characterized by states’ rights and popular sovereignty.  

Hamilton’s creation of the First Bank of the United States (1791) epitomized his vision of honest institutional graft — building structures to support national growth. Jefferson’s agrarian ideal, meanwhile, romanticized a pastoral America while ignoring its reliance on enslaved labor.

### 6. The Abolition Movement: Systematic Ethical Critique  
The abolition movement emerged as the first systematic ethical critique of American society. William Lloyd Garrison’s *The Liberator* (1831) called for immediate emancipation, while Harriet Beecher Stowe’s *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* (1852) galvanized public sentiment against slavery. Frederick Douglass’s *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave* (1845) exposed the brutal realities of enslavement.  

The movement debated ethical strategies: Garrison favored nonviolence, while John Brown’s 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry exemplified violent resistance. This tension continues to shape American ethical thought.

### 7. Indigenous Removal: Justifying Genocide  
The Indian Removal Act (1830) and the resulting Trail of Tears epitomized the ethical failure of American expansionism. Chief Justice John Marshall’s opinion in *Worcester v. Georgia* (1832) affirmed tribal sovereignty, but President Andrew Jackson disregarded it, demonstrating the gap between legal principles and ethical practice.  

Indigenous removal was justified through narratives of Manifest Destiny and racial superiority, revealing the moral contradictions of a nation proclaiming liberty while perpetrating genocide.

### 8. Key Scholars  
- Gordon Wood’s *The Radicalism of the American Revolution* (1991) explores the transformation of American ethics during the Revolution.  
- Edmund Morgan’s *American Slavery, American Freedom* (1975) examines the paradox of liberty and slavery in colonial Virginia.  
- David Brion Davis’s *The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture* (1966) traces the moral contradictions of slavery.  
- Annette Gordon-Reed’s *The Hemingses of Monticello* (2008) sheds light on Jefferson’s personal and moral contradictions.  

The early American ethical tradition is defined by its ideals, its failures, and the enduring tension between the two.

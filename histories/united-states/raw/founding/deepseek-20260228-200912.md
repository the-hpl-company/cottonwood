# American Ethical Thought, 1607–1830: The Contradiction Forged

## 1. Puritan Ethics: Covenant and Exclusion
**Core Framework:** The **Massachusetts Bay Colony Charter (1629)** and John Winthrop’s sermon **“A Model of Christian Charity” (1630)** established a **covenant theology** as the ethical foundation: society as a binding agreement with God to create a “city upon a hill,” a moral exemplar. Ethical standing derived from **election**—the Calvinist doctrine that only some were predestined for salvation. This created an ethics of the **visible saint**, where moral conduct signaled (but did not earn) grace.

**Ethical Failure:** The **Salem witch trials (1692)** exposed the lethal consequence of this framework when combined with social panic—the “elect” defined themselves against perceived demonic others. **Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” (1741)** reframed the ethical imperative around **awakening**—individual conversion as a moral crisis, shifting emphasis from communal covenant to personal repentance, yet still within a binary of salvation and damnation.

## 2. Declaration of Independence: The Foundational Contradiction
**Document:** **The Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776)**, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder of 200+ people. The phrase **“all men are created equal”** was Enlightenment universalism filtered through a Virginia planter’s lens. Jefferson’s original draft included a clause condemning the slave trade as a “cruel war against human nature,” removed at South Carolina and Georgia’s insistence—the first political erasure of the contradiction.

**Lived Reality:** Enslaved people in Monticello, like **Sally Hemings** (whose perspective is recovered by **Annette Gordon-Reed** in *The Hemingses of Monticello*), understood the Declaration’s ideals as a **betrayal in real time**. The **1776 Petition for Freedom by enslaved Massachusetts blacks** directly quoted the Declaration to argue for emancipation: “We have in common with all other men a naturel right to our freedoms.” The gap between principle and practice was immediate and stark.

## 3. The Constitutional Bargain: Encoding Hypocrisy
**The U.S. Constitution (1787)** is a masterwork of ethical compromise that protected slavery through:
- **Article I, Section 2, Clause 3:** The **Three-Fifths Compromise**, counting enslaved people as 3/5 of a person for representation, boosting slaveholding power.
- **Article I, Section 9, Clause 1:** The **slave trade clause**, prohibiting Congress from banning the importation of enslaved people until 1808.
- **Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3:** The **Fugitive Slave Clause**, requiring the return of escaped persons “held to Service or Labour.”

**The Federalist Papers (1787–88)** provided the ethical argument for this system. **Federalist No. 10 (James Madison)** argued a large republic would control “factions,” including abolitionist movements. **Federalist No. 51 (Madison)** famously stated, “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition,” institutionalizing interest against interest—a pragmatic ethic that accepted slavery as a political price for union.

## 4. The Bill of Rights: Limited Protections
**The first ten amendments (ratified 1791)** established an ethical architecture of **negative liberty**—freedom *from* government intrusion. Key protections: **First Amendment** (conscience, speech, assembly), **Fourth Amendment** (privacy), **Fifth Amendment** (due process).

**Critical Omissions:** It protected citizens against federal power but:
- Did not limit state governments (*Barron v. Baltimore*, 1833).
- Did not apply to enslaved people. The **Fifth Amendment’s due process** did not prevent the **Fugitive Slave Act of 1793**.
- Did not address **indigenous sovereignty**—the **Northwest Ordinance (1787)** claimed “utmost good faith” toward tribes while enabling dispossession.

## 5. Hamilton vs. Jefferson: Competing Ethical Visions
**Alexander Hamilton’s ethic** was **nationalist and developmental**: a strong central government, **First Bank of the United States (1791)**, manufacturing, public credit. His **“Report on Manufactures” (1791)** argued for economic diversification as moral stewardship. What he called “**honest graft**”—using state power to build institutions for national strength—was an ethic of collective empowerment through elite direction.

**Thomas Jefferson’s ethic** was **agrarian and decentralized**: the **“yeoman farmer”** as moral ideal, states’ rights, strict constructionism (though he violated this with the **Louisiana Purchase, 1803**). His **“Notes on the State of Virginia (1785)”** expressed fear of urban corruption and racial mixing. This vision depended on enslaved labor and westward expansion onto indigenous land.

## 6. The Abolition Movement: The First Systematic Ethical Critique
**Early voices:** **Quaker petitions (1688 Germantown Petition)** and **Benjamin Lay’s *All Slave-Keepers That Keep the Innocent in Bondage* (1737)** framed slavery as sin.

**Systematic activism:** **William Lloyd Garrison’s *The Liberator* (1831)** declared, “I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice.” **David Walker’s *Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World* (1829)** demanded immediate emancipation, warning of violence if denied.

**Frederick Douglass’s *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* (1845)** exposed the ethical bankruptcy of Christian slaveholders. His **“What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” (1852)** deconstructed the national myth: “This Fourth of July is *yours*, not *mine*… Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.”

**Violence as ethics:** **John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry (1859)** forced the question: was violence morally necessary to end a violent institution? Brown’s courtroom speech framed his actions as fulfilling the **“Golden Rule.”**

## 7. Indigenous Removal: Liberty as Genocide
**Legal framework:** **Johnson v. M’Intosh (1823)** established the **“doctrine of discovery,”** giving European nations superior title to indigenous land. **Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831)** deemed tribes “domestic dependent nations,” not sovereigns. **Worcester v. Georgia (1832)** affirmed tribal sovereignty but was ignored by **President Andrew Jackson**.

**The Indian Removal Act (1830)** forced the **Trail of Tears (1838–39)**, death march of the Cherokee. Justification came from **Jefferson’s “civilization or extinction” dichotomy** and **Jackson’s rhetoric of paternalistic benevolence**—claiming removal would save tribes from annihilation while seizing their land for white settlers. This embodied the **“American freedom” Edmund Morgan identified** in *American Slavery, American Freedom*: liberty for settlers built on the subjugation of others.

## 8. Scholarly Frameworks: Understanding the Contradiction
- **Edmund Morgan (*American Slavery, American Freedom*, 1975):** Argued that **racial slavery enabled white republican equality** in Virginia—the central American paradox.
- **David Brion Davis (*The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution*, 1975):** Traced how Enlightenment ideals coexisted with and sometimes challenged slavery.
- **Gordon Wood (*The Radicalism of the American Revolution*, 1992):** Emphasized the Revolution’s transformative, democratizing ethos, yet acknowledged its limits.
- **Annette Gordon-Reed (*The Hemingses of Monticello*, 2008):** Recovered the lived experience of the contradiction within Jefferson’s own household.

**Conclusion: The American Ethical Tradition, 1607–1830**
The period forged an ethical nation **defined by its gap**. The **Puritan covenant** became the **“city upon a hill”** national mission. The **Declaration’s equality** was weaponized by the enslaved and excluded even as it was denied. The **Constitution** balanced liberty and slavery through **compromises that were moral failures**. The **abolition movement** arose as the **conscience of the contradiction**, while **Indian removal** demonstrated that **American expansion required ethical blindness**. This is not a story of progress but of **ongoing tension**—an ethical tradition built on a foundational rift that every generation must confront.

## American Ethical Thought: Contradictions of Liberty (1607-1830)

American ethical thought from colonial settlement through the early republic is defined by a fundamental contradiction: the simultaneous embrace of liberty and the perpetuation of slavery and dispossession. This tension, woven into the nation's founding documents and philosophical debates, continues to shape American identity.

**1. Puritan Ethics:**

The Puritans sought to establish a "city upon a hill" in New England, a model society guided by their interpretation of God's law. **John Winthrop**, in his 1630 sermon "A Model of Christian Charity," called on colonists to act with love, unity, and selflessness, embodying Christian virtues for the world to emulate. This vision rested on **covenant theology**, a contractual relationship between God and humanity, demanding strict adherence to religious and moral principles. The "elect," those predestined for salvation, bore a special responsibility to uphold these standards.

However, Puritan ethics also revealed profound flaws. The **Salem witch trials of 1692** exposed the dangers of religious extremism, social paranoia, and the abuse of power, leading to the unjust persecution and execution of innocent individuals. **Jonathan Edwards**, a key figure in the **Great Awakening** of the 1730s and 1740s, sought to revive Puritan fervor through passionate sermons emphasizing human sinfulness and the need for divine grace. Edwards's intense focus on individual conversion and emotional experience, while influential, also reflected the inherent tensions between individual freedom and communal control within Puritan thought.

**2. The Declaration of Independence:**

The **Declaration of Independence (1776)** proclaimed the self-evident truth that "all men are created equal," endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, its author, **Thomas Jefferson**, was a slaveholder. This contradiction is central to understanding American ethical thought.

What did Jefferson mean by "all men?" Some historians argue he intended it to apply only to white men, while others suggest a broader vision limited by his social context. Regardless, the enslaved people in his household, like those across the colonies, understood the Declaration as a promise of freedom denied to them. This dissonance fueled the abolitionist movement and continues to challenge the nation's understanding of equality.

**3. The Constitutional Bargain:**

The **Constitution of 1787** further enshrined the contradiction between liberty and slavery. The **Three-Fifths Compromise (Article I, Section 2)** counted enslaved people as three-fifths of a person for purposes of representation, granting disproportionate political power to slaveholding states. The **Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2)** required the return of escaped slaves, reinforcing the institution of slavery. The Constitution also included a provision delaying the prohibition of the slave trade until 1808 (Article I, Section 9).

These compromises, while intended to secure national unity, demonstrated the prioritization of economic and political interests over the rights and dignity of enslaved people. **The Federalist Papers**, especially **Federalist No. 10** and **Federalist No. 51**, argued for a system of checks and balances and the representation of diverse interests to prevent tyranny. However, these arguments largely ignored the ethical implications of protecting the interests of slaveholders at the expense of enslaved people.

**4. The Bill of Rights:**

The **Bill of Rights (1791)**, comprising the first ten amendments to the Constitution, aimed to protect individual liberties against government overreach. It guaranteed freedom of speech, religion, the press, the right to bear arms, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to due process and a fair trial. However, these protections were primarily intended for white men, leaving enslaved people, Native Americans, and women largely excluded.

The Bill of Rights established an ethical architecture of **limited government**, but its limitations exposed the inherent inequalities of the American social order.

**5. Hamilton vs. Jefferson:**

The rivalry between **Alexander Hamilton** and **Thomas Jefferson** represented two competing ethical visions for the new nation. Hamilton advocated for a strong central government, industrial development, and a national bank, believing these were necessary for economic prosperity and national strength. He established the **First Bank of the United States** in 1791. Jefferson, on the other hand, championed an agrarian republic, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, fearing that centralized power would lead to tyranny. He also honestly built the Library of Congress.

Their disagreements reflected fundamental differences in their understanding of human nature, the role of government, and the sources of social and economic well-being.

**6. The Abolition Movement:**

The abolition movement emerged as the earliest systematic ethical critique of American society. **Frederick Douglass**, an escaped slave and prominent abolitionist, delivered his powerful speech, **"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" (1852)**, exposing the hypocrisy of celebrating freedom while upholding slavery. His **Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845)**, offered a firsthand account of the brutality of slavery and the humanity of enslaved people. **Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852)**, a fictional portrayal of slavery, further galvanized public opinion against the institution. **William Lloyd Garrison**, a radical abolitionist, advocated for immediate emancipation and denounced the Constitution as a pro-slavery document.

The movement debated the ethics of violent vs. nonviolent resistance. **John Brown's** raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, aimed at inciting a slave rebellion, exemplified the radical fringe of the movement, willing to use violence to achieve its goals.

**7. Indigenous Removal:**

The expansion of the United States was accompanied by the forced removal and dispossession of Native American tribes. The **Indian Removal Act of 1830** authorized the forced relocation of tribes from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to territories west of the Mississippi River. The Supreme Court's decision in **Worcester v. Georgia (1832)**, while affirming the sovereignty of tribal nations, was largely ignored by the Jackson administration. The **Trail of Tears**, the forced march of the Cherokee Nation in 1838-1839, resulted in the deaths of thousands of people.

American ethical thought often justified this genocide by portraying Native Americans as uncivilized obstacles to progress, rationalizing the violation of their rights and the seizure of their lands in the name of national expansion.

**8. Key Scholars:**

Scholars like **Gordon Wood** have examined the radicalism of the American Revolution and its impact on American political thought. **Edmund Morgan**, in "American Slavery, American Freedom," explored the paradox of Virginia's embrace of republican ideals alongside its reliance on slave labor. **David Brion Davis** traced the evolution of anti-slavery thought in Western culture. **Annette Gordon-Reed** has shed light on the complex relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, challenging traditional narratives and offering a more nuanced understanding of Jefferson's life and legacy.

In conclusion, American ethical thought from colonial settlement through the early republic was marked by a profound contradiction between its ideals of liberty and equality and its practice of slavery, dispossession, and exclusion. This contradiction, enshrined in founding documents and reflected in philosophical debates, continues to shape the nation's identity and its ongoing struggle to live up to its professed values.

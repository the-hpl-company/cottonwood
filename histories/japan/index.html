<p><em>This page traces the intellectual and moral traditions of Japan on its own terms — the people, the events, the ideas as they emerged in context.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="foundations-shinto-ritual-and-the-ethics-of-purity-and-pollution">Foundations — Shinto, Ritual, and the Ethics of Purity and Pollution</h2>
<p>Okay, here is an account of the foundational ethical frameworks in Japan, from prehistory through the 6th century CE, drawing on primary sources and major scholarship:</p>
<p><strong>1. Shinto Ethics:</strong></p>
<p>Shinto, meaning &ldquo;the way of the <em>kami</em>,&rdquo; is the indigenous religious tradition of Japan. It does not have a single founder or a codified scripture in the same way as Buddhism or Christianity. Instead, Shinto ethics are woven into myth, ritual, and daily life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Kegare</em></strong> <strong>(Impurity) and</strong> <strong><em>Harae</em></strong> <strong>(Purification):</strong> A central concept in Shinto ethics is <em>kegare</em>, often translated as pollution, impurity, or defilement. <em>Kegare</em> is not necessarily moral evil, but rather a state of imbalance that disrupts the natural order and the relationship between humans and the <em>kami</em>. <em>Kegare</em> can arise from contact with death, disease, menstruation, or wrongdoing. <em>Harae</em> is the practice of purification, aimed at removing <em>kegare</em> and restoring harmony. Ritual cleansing with water, salt, or fire are common forms of <em>harae</em>. As scholar Helen Hardacre notes, &ldquo;Purity is next to godliness&rdquo; in Shinto, and maintaining purity is a constant ethical concern. (Hardacre, <em>Shinto and the State, 1868-1988</em>, p. 11).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Musubi</em></strong> <strong>(Creative/Harmonizing Power):</strong> <em>Musubi</em> refers to the generative and harmonizing power that connects all things. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the world and the importance of fostering positive relationships. <em>Musubi</em> is the force that brings things into being and maintains balance. Ethical action, in this context, involves aligning oneself with <em>musubi</em> and contributing to the flourishing of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong><em>Kojiki</em></strong> <strong>(712) and</strong> <strong><em>Nihon Shoki</em></strong> <strong>(720) as Ethical Texts:</strong> These are the earliest extant written records of Japanese myths and history. While not explicitly ethical treatises, they provide a foundation for Shinto ethics by narrating the origins of the world, the <em>kami</em>, and the Japanese imperial line.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creation Myths:</strong> The <em>Kojiki</em> and <em>Nihon Shoki</em> describe the creation of Japan by the <em>kami</em> Izanagi and Izanami. Their union and subsequent creation of the islands of Japan and various <em>kami</em> establish a model of harmonious cooperation and the sacredness of the land. However, the myth also includes the tragic death of Izanami and Izanagi&rsquo;s descent to the underworld (<em>Yomi</em>), highlighting the ever-present threat of <em>kegare</em> and the need for purification.</li>
<li><strong>Amaterasu and the Imperial Line:</strong> The most important deity in Shinto is Amaterasu-ōmikami, the sun goddess. The <em>Kojiki</em> recounts how her grandson, Ninigi-no-Mikoto, was sent to earth to rule Japan, establishing the divine lineage of the imperial family. This myth provides a basis for the emperor&rsquo;s authority and the idea of Japan as a divinely ordained nation. However, it also contains episodes of conflict and deception, such as the story of Susano-o&rsquo;s disruptive behavior and Amaterasu&rsquo;s temporary withdrawal into a cave, which plunged the world into darkness. These narratives suggest that even the divine realm is not immune to disharmony and that ethical action is necessary to maintain order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Concept of</strong> <strong><em>Wa</em></strong> <strong>(Harmony):</strong></p>
<p><em>Wa</em>, meaning harmony, peace, or concord, is often presented as a central value in Japanese culture. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining social cohesion and avoiding conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prince Shotoku&rsquo;s Seventeen-Article Constitution (604):</strong> This document, attributed to Prince Shotoku, is one of the earliest examples of Japanese political and ethical thought. Its first article states: &ldquo;Harmony is to be valued, and contentiousness avoided. For all men are inclined to partisanship, and few are discerning. Hence there are some who disobey their lords and fathers, or who clash with their neighbors. But when those above are harmonious and those below are conciliatory, there is concord in the discussion of all matters, and the accomplishment of every undertaking.&rdquo; (Article 1, Seventeen-Article Constitution).<ul>
<li>This emphasis on <em>wa</em> reflects a desire for social stability and cooperation in the face of political and social upheaval. However, as scholars like Mark Teeuwen argue, the pursuit of <em>wa</em> can also suppress dissent and reinforce existing power structures. Whose harmony is being prioritized? Who is silenced in the name of maintaining social order? (Teeuwen, <em>A History of Shinto</em>, p. 45).</li>
<li>The Constitution also incorporates Buddhist and Confucian principles, such as reverence for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) and the importance of ethical leadership. This reflects an early attempt to synthesize different ethical systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The Relationship Between</strong> <strong><em>Kami</em></strong> <strong>and Ethical Obligation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Kami</em></strong> <strong>as Immanent Divinity:</strong> <em>Kami</em> are divine spirits or forces that inhabit all things – natural objects like mountains, trees, and rivers, as well as ancestors, heroes, and abstract concepts. This belief in the immanence of divinity shapes ethical obligations in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverence for Nature:</strong> The belief that <em>kami</em> reside in nature fosters a sense of respect and responsibility towards the environment. Actions that harm or pollute the natural world are seen as disrespectful to the <em>kami</em> and disruptive to the harmony of the universe.</li>
<li><strong>Ancestor Veneration:</strong> Ancestors are considered <em>kami</em> and are venerated through rituals and offerings. This reinforces family ties and emphasizes the importance of honoring one&rsquo;s heritage.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Conduct:</strong> Ethical behavior is seen as a way of pleasing the <em>kami</em> and maintaining their favor. Conversely, unethical actions can bring about misfortune or divine retribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Difference from Monotheistic Ethical Obligation:</strong> Unlike monotheistic religions, where ethical obligations are often based on divine commands, Shinto ethics are more closely tied to the natural world and social relationships. There is no single, all-powerful god who dictates morality. Instead, ethical obligations arise from the desire to live in harmony with the <em>kami</em> and to maintain the well-being of the community. As John Breen and Mark Teeuwen argue, Shinto ethics are less about abstract principles and more about concrete practices and rituals that cultivate a sense of connection to the divine and the natural world. (Breen and Teeuwen, <em>Shinto: A Short History</em>, p. 15).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. The Arrival of Buddhism (6th Century):</strong></p>
<p>Buddhism arrived in Japan from Korea in the 6th century, bringing with it a complex system of philosophy, ethics, and ritual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forms of Buddhism:</strong> The forms of Buddhism that initially arrived in Japan were primarily Mahayana traditions from China and Korea, emphasizing the bodhisattva ideal of universal salvation and the importance of compassion. Key concepts included:<ul>
<li><strong>The Four Noble Truths:</strong> Suffering exists, it has a cause, it can be overcome, and there is a path to liberation.</li>
<li><strong>The Eightfold Path:</strong> Right understanding, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.</li>
<li><strong>Karma and Rebirth:</strong> Actions have consequences that affect one&rsquo;s future lives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Synthesis of Buddhist and Shinto Ethics:</strong> Early Japanese thinkers sought to integrate Buddhist ethics with existing Shinto beliefs. One common approach was to view the <em>kami</em> as local manifestations of Buddhist deities (a process called <em>shinbutsu-shūgō</em>, syncretism of <em>kami</em> and buddhas). This allowed people to venerate both the <em>kami</em> and the Buddha without necessarily seeing them as contradictory.<ul>
<li>Prince Shotoku, for example, promoted Buddhism as a way to enhance the moral character of the nation and to bring peace and prosperity. He saw Buddhism as complementary to Shinto, rather than as a replacement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Soga-Mononobe Conflict:</strong> The introduction of Buddhism was not without conflict. The Soga clan, who were early adopters of Buddhism, clashed with the Mononobe clan, who staunchly defended traditional Shinto beliefs. This conflict was not purely religious; it also involved political power struggles. The Soga clan&rsquo;s eventual victory paved the way for the widespread adoption of Buddhism in Japan, but it also marked a period of social and political upheaval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Ainu Ethical Traditions:</strong></p>
<p>The Ainu are the indigenous people of northern Japan (Hokkaido) and parts of Russia. Their ethical traditions are deeply intertwined with their relationship with the natural world and their belief in <em>kamuy</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Kamuy</em></strong> <strong>(Divine Beings):</strong> <em>Kamuy</em> are divine beings that inhabit all things in the natural world, similar to the Shinto <em>kami</em>. Animals, plants, mountains, and rivers are all considered <em>kamuy</em>. Respect for <em>kamuy</em> is central to Ainu ethics.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <strong><em>Iomante</em></strong> <strong>Ceremony:</strong> The <em>iomante</em> is a ritual in which a bear cub is raised for a period of time and then sacrificed. The ritual is seen as a way of sending the bear&rsquo;s spirit back to the realm of the <em>kamuy</em> with honor and gratitude. It is a complex and controversial practice, but it reflects the Ainu belief in the cyclical nature of life and the importance of maintaining a balanced relationship with the <em>kamuy</em>.<ul>
<li>As Donald Philippi explains, &ldquo;The bear is regarded as a divine messenger… The bear is sent back to the mountain, its homeland, with gifts and honors, so that it may intercede with the gods on behalf of the Ainu people.&rdquo; (Philippi, <em>Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans</em>, p. 22).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Suppression and Persistence:</strong> During the Meiji period (1868-1912), the Japanese government implemented policies aimed at assimilating the Ainu into Japanese society. These policies included banning Ainu language, customs, and religious practices, including the <em>iomante</em>. While these policies have had a devastating impact on Ainu culture, Ainu people have continued to preserve their traditions and to advocate for their rights. Today, there is a growing movement to revitalize Ainu language and culture and to recognize the Ainu as an indigenous people with distinct rights and traditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Key Scholars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helen Hardacre:</strong> A leading scholar of Shinto, Hardacre has written extensively on the relationship between Shinto and the state, as well as on the role of women in Shinto.</li>
<li><strong>John Breen and Mark Teeuwen:</strong> Breen and Teeuwen are historians of Shinto who have emphasized the importance of understanding Shinto as a dynamic and evolving tradition, rather than as a static set of beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Donald Philippi:</strong> A translator and scholar of Japanese and Ainu literature, Philippi has made important contributions to the understanding of Ainu culture and religion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the foundational ethical frameworks of Japan were shaped by Shinto&rsquo;s emphasis on purity, harmony, and reverence for nature, as well as by the later introduction of Buddhist ethics. These traditions have been both complementary and conflicting, and they have been constantly reinterpreted and adapted over time. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s crucial to acknowledge the existence and suppression of Ainu ethical traditions, underscoring the importance of recognizing diverse perspectives within Japan&rsquo;s ethical landscape.</p>

<h2 id="buddhist-and-confucian-synthesis-nara-through-muromachi">Buddhist and Confucian Synthesis — Nara through Muromachi</h2>
<h2 id="the-synthesis-of-buddhism-and-confucianism-in-japanese-ethical-thought-600-1500-ce">The Synthesis of Buddhism and Confucianism in Japanese Ethical Thought (600-1500 CE)</h2>
<p>The period between 600 and 1500 CE witnessed a profound synthesis of Buddhist and Confucian thought in Japan, shaping the ethical landscape in unique and enduring ways. This synthesis was not a simple fusion, but a dynamic interplay of adaptation, reinterpretation, and tension, resulting in a complex ethical tapestry woven into the fabric of Japanese society.</p>
<p><strong>1. Nara Buddhism (710-794): Merit, State, and Welfare</strong></p>
<p>The Nara period saw the flourishing of Buddhism, with six major schools (三論宗 Sanron-shū, 成實宗 Jōjitsu-shū, 法相宗 Hossō-shū, 倶舎宗 Kusha-shū, 華厳宗 Kegon-shū, and 律宗 Ritsu-shū) establishing themselves. These schools, while differing in their doctrinal nuances, shared a common emphasis on <em>merit-making</em> (功徳 kudoku) as a path to enlightenment and a means of securing worldly benefits. The state actively promoted Buddhism as a means of national protection and unification, as exemplified by Emperor Shōmu (聖武天皇, r. 724-749) and the construction of the Tōdai-ji (東大寺) temple and its massive bronze Buddha statue. This project, completed in 752, was intended to ensure the well-being of the state and its people.</p>
<p>Emperor Shōmu&rsquo;s reign saw a shift in political ethics, viewing the emperor not merely as a ruler but as a protector of Buddhism and a guarantor of the people&rsquo;s welfare. The construction of the Tōdai-ji was justified by the <em>Konkōmyō Saishōōkyō</em> (金光明最勝王経, <em>Golden Light Sutra</em>), which promised protection to rulers who upheld the Buddhist dharma. Buddhist temples, like the Saidai-ji, also played a significant role in providing social services, including care for the sick, the poor, and the elderly. The <em>Shoku Nihongi</em> (続日本紀, <em>Chronicle of Japan Continued</em>, 797) records instances of temples distributing food and medicine to the needy during times of famine and plague, reflecting the compassionate ethos of Buddhism in practice.</p>
<p><strong>2. Heian Buddhism: Esoteric Ethics and Embodied Enlightenment</strong></p>
<p>The Heian period (794-1185) witnessed the rise of Tendai and Shingon Buddhism, schools characterized by their esoteric teachings and holistic approach to spiritual practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kūkai (空海, 774-835)</strong>, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, emphasized the <em>interconnectedness of all beings</em> (緣起 engi) through the concept of <em>Dharmakaya</em> (法身 hosshin), the universal Buddha-body pervading all existence. His ethical framework was rooted in the idea that harming others is ultimately harming oneself, as all beings are part of the same cosmic reality. Kūkai&rsquo;s doctrine of <em>sokushin jōbutsu</em> (即身成仏, attaining Buddhahood in this very body) implied that enlightenment was not a distant goal but a present possibility, achievable through ritual practice and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion. This concept democratized the path to enlightenment, suggesting that anyone, regardless of social status, could achieve liberation.</li>
<li><strong>Saichō (最澄, 767-822)</strong>, the founder of Tendai Buddhism, sought to create a holistic system integrating Zen, Esoteric Buddhism, precepts, and Pure Land practices. Saicho’s Enkai precepts emphasized universal salvation, and were meant to replace the Hinayana-based precepts of the Nara schools. Saicho also emphasized the importance of the Lotus Sutra (<em>Hokkekyō</em>, 法華経), which held all beings, even women and evil people, had the potential to attain buddhahood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Kamakura Buddhism (1185-1333): Ethics for the Masses</strong></p>
<p>The Kamakura period saw the emergence of new Buddhist schools that emphasized accessibility and direct practice, profoundly impacting Japanese ethics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hōnen (法然, 1133-1212)</strong>, the founder of Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo-shū, 浄土宗), revolutionized Buddhist ethics by proclaiming that salvation was available to all, regardless of their social status or intellectual ability. He advocated the practice of <em>nembutsu</em> (念仏), the recitation of the name of Amida Buddha (阿弥陀仏), as the sole means of achieving rebirth in the Pure Land. Hōnen&rsquo;s teachings, outlined in his <em>Senchakushū</em> (選択集, <em>Passages on the Selection of the Nembutsu in the Primal Vow</em>, 1198), challenged the traditional emphasis on monastic discipline and intellectual understanding, making salvation accessible to the masses.</li>
<li><strong>Shinran (親鸞, 1173-1262)</strong>, Hōnen&rsquo;s disciple and the founder of True Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo Shinshū, 浄土真宗), further radicalized Pure Land ethics by emphasizing the concept of <em>tariki</em> (他力, other-power), the reliance on Amida&rsquo;s grace for salvation. Shinran famously stated, &ldquo;Even a good person can be reborn in the Pure Land, how much more so an evil person,&rdquo; highlighting the transformative power of Amida&rsquo;s compassion, which embraces all beings, regardless of their moral failings. Shinran’s <em>Tannishō</em> (歎異抄, <em>Notes Lamenting Differences</em>, c. 1289) captures his radical vision of grace.</li>
<li><strong>Dōgen (道元, 1200-1253)</strong>, the founder of Sōtō Zen (曹洞禅), emphasized the practice of <em>shikantaza</em> (只管打坐, just sitting) as the direct realization of enlightenment. Dōgen&rsquo;s ethics were rooted in the idea that <em>practice is enlightenment</em> (修証一等 shushō ittō), meaning that the very act of sitting in meditation embodies the wisdom and compassion of the Buddha. Dōgen&rsquo;s <em>Shōbōgenzō</em> (正法眼蔵, <em>Treasury of the True Dharma Eye</em>, 1231-1253) explores the ethical implications of Zen practice, emphasizing mindfulness, non-duality, and the interconnectedness of all things.</li>
<li><strong>Nichiren (日蓮, 1222-1282)</strong>, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, adopted a prophetic stance, criticizing the government and other Buddhist schools for failing to uphold the true Dharma. Nichiren advocated the practice of chanting the <em>Daimoku</em> (題目), the title of the Lotus Sutra (<em>Nam-myoho-renge-kyo</em>, 南無妙法蓮華経), as the means of achieving personal and societal transformation. Nichiren&rsquo;s ethical vision was rooted in the belief that the Lotus Sutra contained the ultimate truth, and that its propagation was essential for the well-being of Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Zen Ethics: Emptiness, Warriors, and Weaponization</strong></p>
<p>Zen Buddhism, with its emphasis on <em>emptiness</em> (空 kū) and <em>no-mind</em> (無心 mushin), presents a paradoxical ethical framework. The concept of no-mind, often interpreted as a state of spontaneity and non-attachment, raises questions about moral responsibility. Does a mind free from conceptual thought negate the need for ethical considerations?</p>
<p>Zen ethics, however, does not advocate moral nihilism. Rather, it emphasizes the importance of acting from a place of <em>non-duality</em>, recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the absence of a separate self. The Zen master&rsquo;s relationship to the warrior class highlights this tension. Zen monks, such as Takuan Sōhō (沢庵宗彭, 1573-1645), served as spiritual advisors to samurai, teaching them how to cultivate a mind free from fear and hesitation in battle. This association led to the <em>weaponization of Zen</em>, as its principles were used to justify violence and aggression. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that Zen ethics, at its core, emphasizes compassion and non-violence, and that its misuse by the warrior class represents a distortion of its original intent.</p>
<p><strong>5. Literature as Ethical Instruction: <em>The Tale of Genji<em> and </em>Heike Monogatari</em></strong></p>
<p>Japanese literature, particularly <em>The Tale of Genji</em> (源氏物語, <em>Genji Monogatari</em>, c. 1000-1020) and <em>The Tale of the Heike</em> (平家物語, <em>Heike Monogatari</em>, c. 1330), offers profound insights into Japanese ethical sensibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Tale of Genji</em> explores the complexities of human relationships, highlighting the importance of empathy, sensitivity, and aesthetic appreciation. The concept of <em>mono no aware</em> (物の哀れ, the pathos of things), the bittersweet awareness of the transience of life, permeates the narrative, encouraging readers to cultivate a compassionate understanding of human suffering.</li>
<li><em>The Tale of the Heike</em> narrates the rise and fall of the Taira clan, illustrating the Buddhist concept of <em>mujō</em> (無常, impermanence). The epic emphasizes the futility of worldly ambition and the inevitability of death, urging readers to cultivate detachment and seek enlightenment. The famous opening lines, &ldquo;The sound of the Gion Shōja bells echoes the impermanence of all things; the color of the sāla flowers reveals the truth that the prosperous must decline,&rdquo; encapsulate the Buddhist worldview that underpins the narrative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Medieval Confucianism in Japan: Adaptation and Transformation</strong></p>
<p>Confucianism entered Japan primarily through Korea, and was eagerly received by the Japanese aristocracy. During the medieval period, Confucian ethics gained increasing influence in Japan, particularly within the samurai class. Japanese thinkers selectively adopted and transformed Chinese Confucianism to suit their own cultural and political needs.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the importance of filial piety (孝 kō) and social harmony, Japanese Confucian scholars, such as Fujiwara Seika (藤原惺窩, 1561-1619) and Hayashi Razan (林羅山, 1583-1657), emphasized the importance of loyalty to one&rsquo;s lord (忠 chū) as a paramount virtue. This emphasis on loyalty reflected the hierarchical structure of feudal society and the warrior ethic of <em>bushidō</em> (武士道, the way of the warrior). Japanese Confucianism also tended to emphasize the practical application of ethical principles over abstract metaphysical speculation, focusing on the cultivation of moral character and the maintenance of social order.</p>
<p><strong>7. Key Scholars</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>William LaFleur:</strong> Known for his work on the ethics of abortion in Japan and for his insights into Japanese aesthetics and its relationship to Buddhist thought.</li>
<li><strong>Bernard Faure:</strong> A scholar of Zen Buddhism, Faure has explored the complex relationship between Zen and violence, challenging simplistic interpretations of Zen ethics.</li>
<li><strong>Jacqueline Stone:</strong> A leading scholar of Kamakura Buddhism, Stone has examined the social and ethical implications of Pure Land Buddhism and the role of women in Buddhist practice.</li>
<li><strong>Robert Bellah:</strong> Bellah&rsquo;s work on <em>Tokugawa Religion</em> explores the synthesis of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shinto in shaping Japanese values and social institutions during the Tokugawa period.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, the synthesis of Buddhism and Confucianism in Japan between 600 and 1500 CE resulted in a complex and multifaceted ethical landscape. This synthesis was characterized by the adaptation and transformation of imported ideas, the emergence of new ethical frameworks, and the ongoing tension between competing values. From the state-sponsored Buddhism of the Nara period to the accessible ethics of Kamakura Buddhism, and from the aesthetic sensibilities of <em>The Tale of Genji</em> to the warrior ethic of <em>bushidō</em>, Japanese ethical thought during this period shaped the moral contours of Japanese society and continues to resonate in contemporary Japan.</p>

<h2 id="tokugawa-ethics-harmony-hierarchy-and-heresy-1603-1868">Tokugawa Ethics: Harmony, Hierarchy, and Heresy (1603-1868)</h2>
<p>The Tokugawa period (1603-1868) in Japan was a time of enforced peace under the <em>bakufu</em> (shogunate), a rigid social hierarchy, and a complex interplay of ethical frameworks. While Neo-Confucianism served as the official ideology, other schools of thought – <em>bushido</em>, <em>kokugaku</em>, &ldquo;Japanese Enlightenment&rdquo; thinkers, and merchant ethics – offered alternative perspectives, creating a dynamic and often contradictory moral landscape. The policy of <em>sakoku</em> (national seclusion) further shaped ethical considerations related to self-reliance, cultural purity, and interactions with the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>1. Neo-Confucianism as State Ideology:</strong></p>
<p>The Tokugawa shogunate, seeking to stabilize its rule, embraced Neo-Confucianism, specifically the teachings of Zhu Xi (Shushi, 朱熹, 1130-1200), as its official ideology. Hayashi Razan (林羅山, 1583-1657), a prominent scholar, played a key role in adapting Zhu Xi&rsquo;s philosophy to the Japanese context. Razan argued for a hierarchical social order based on the &ldquo;four classes&rdquo; (<em>shi-no-ko-sho</em>, 士農工商): samurai (warriors), farmers, artisans, and merchants. This system, borrowed from Chinese thought, was justified through Confucian principles of social harmony and the idea that each class had a specific role to play in maintaining the well-being of society.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hayashi Razan&rsquo;s <em>Razan Sensei Bunshu</em></strong>: This collection of Razan&rsquo;s writings articulates the Confucian basis for social hierarchy, emphasizing the importance of filial piety (<em>ko</em>, 孝) and loyalty (<em>chu</em>, 忠) to one&rsquo;s superiors. The samurai, as the ruling class, were expected to embody these virtues, serving as moral exemplars for the rest of society.</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Neo-Confucianism provided a framework for legitimizing the shogunate&rsquo;s rule and reinforcing social stability. Education was standardized along Neo-Confucian lines, with the establishment of schools like the <em>Shoheiko</em> (昌平黌) in Edo. This led to the widespread dissemination of Confucian values, shaping the ethical consciousness of the samurai class and influencing other social groups. However, the rigid social hierarchy also created resentment and social tensions, particularly among the lower classes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. <em>Bushido</em>: The Way of the Warrior</strong></p>
<p><em>Bushido</em> (武士道, the way of the warrior) was a complex and evolving ethical code for the samurai class. It emphasized virtues such as loyalty, courage, honor, and self-sacrifice. While often romanticized in later narratives, <em>bushido</em> in the Tokugawa period was a pragmatic set of guidelines for maintaining social order and upholding the samurai&rsquo;s status.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yamamoto Tsunetomo&rsquo;s <em>Hagakure</em> (葉隠, 1716):</strong> This text, dictated by Yamamoto Tsunetomo (山本常朝, 1659-1719), a former samurai of the Saga domain, presents a radical view of <em>bushido</em>. The famous line, &ldquo;The way of the warrior is death,&rdquo; reflects the idea that a samurai should be willing to die for his lord without hesitation. <em>Hagakure</em> emphasizes unwavering loyalty, even to the point of irrationality, and encourages a constant awareness of death to overcome fear and self-interest.</li>
<li><strong>Yamaga Soko (山鹿素行, 1622-1685):</strong> Soko offered a more measured approach to <em>bushido</em>, emphasizing the samurai&rsquo;s role as a moral leader and scholar. He advocated for a combination of martial skills and Confucian learning, arguing that the samurai should be a model of ethical conduct for the rest of society.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Forty-Seven Ronin (元禄赤穂事件, Genroku Ako Incident, 1701-1703):</strong> This event became a defining ethical case study in Japanese history. After their lord, Asano Naganori, was forced to commit suicide for drawing his sword in Edo Castle, his retainers became <em>ronin</em> (masterless samurai). They plotted revenge against Kira Yoshinaka, the official who had provoked Asano. After two years of planning, the <em>ronin</em> successfully assassinated Kira and then surrendered to the authorities. The shogunate, faced with a difficult dilemma, ultimately ordered the <em>ronin</em> to commit <em>seppuku</em> (ritual suicide).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethical Debate:</strong> The Forty-Seven Ronin raised complex questions about loyalty (<em>chu</em>) versus righteousness (<em>gi</em>), revenge versus justice, and the individual&rsquo;s duty to the state. While their loyalty to their lord was widely admired, their act of revenge violated the law and challenged the authority of the shogunate. The story of the Forty-Seven Ronin became a powerful symbol of <em>bushido</em> ideals, but also highlighted the inherent tensions within the samurai ethic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. <em>Kokugaku</em>: National Learning</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Kokugaku</em> (国学, National Learning) school emerged as a reaction against the perceived dominance of Chinese thought, particularly Confucianism and Buddhism. <em>Kokugaku</em> scholars sought to recover and celebrate indigenous Japanese traditions, focusing on ancient texts like the <em>Kojiki</em> (古事記, Record of Ancient Matters, 712) and the <em>Nihon Shoki</em> (日本書紀, Chronicles of Japan, 720).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motoori Norinaga (本居宣長, 1730-1801):</strong> A leading figure in <em>Kokugaku</em>, Norinaga emphasized the concept of <em>mono no aware</em> (物の哀れ), a sensitivity to the beauty and pathos of the world. He criticized Confucianism for its emphasis on reason and morality, arguing that it suppressed natural human emotions. Norinaga believed that true Japanese virtue lay in embracing these emotions and living in accordance with the natural order.</li>
<li><strong>Hirata Atsutane (平田篤胤, 1776-1843):</strong> Atsutane further radicalized <em>Kokugaku</em>, advocating for a revival of Shinto and the expulsion of foreign influences. He promoted a vision of Japan as a divinely ordained nation with a unique spiritual essence. Atsutane&rsquo;s ideas contributed to the rise of ultranationalism in the late Tokugawa and Meiji periods.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Framework:</strong> <em>Kokugaku</em> promoted an ethical framework based on the idea of <em>makoto</em> (真), sincerity or purity of heart. This involved living in accordance with one&rsquo;s natural feelings and respecting the ancient traditions of Japan. <em>Kokugaku</em> also emphasized the importance of loyalty to the emperor, whom it viewed as a descendant of the gods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Japanese Enlightenment Thinkers</strong></p>
<p>While Neo-Confucianism dominated official discourse, several thinkers challenged its orthodoxy and offered alternative ethical visions. These &ldquo;Japanese Enlightenment&rdquo; thinkers questioned traditional authority and advocated for more rational and humane approaches to governance and social life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ogyu Sorai (荻生徂徠, 1666-1728):</strong> Sorai criticized Zhu Xi Confucianism for its abstract moralizing and its failure to address the practical needs of society. He argued that the true purpose of Confucianism was to provide a framework for effective governance. Sorai advocated for a return to the original teachings of Confucius and emphasized the importance of studying the historical context of the Confucian classics.</li>
<li><strong>Ito Jinsai (伊藤仁斎, 1627-1705):</strong> Jinsai emphasized the importance of <em>ren</em> (仁, humaneness), arguing that it was the foundation of all virtues. He criticized Zhu Xi Confucianism for its emphasis on abstract principles, arguing that it neglected the importance of cultivating compassion and empathy.</li>
<li><strong>Ando Shoeki (安藤昌益, 1703-1762):</strong> Shoeki was a radical social critic who advocated for a utopian society based on equality and communal ownership of land. He condemned the existing social hierarchy and the exploitation of farmers by the ruling class. Shoeki&rsquo;s ideas were far ahead of his time and had little immediate impact, but he is now recognized as one of the most original and radical thinkers in Japanese history. His surviving work is the <em>Shizen Shin&rsquo;eido</em> (自然真営道, The Natural Way of Farming)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Merchant Class Ethics: <em>Shingaku</em></strong></p>
<p>The rise of a wealthy merchant class in the Tokugawa period challenged the traditional social hierarchy and created a need for a new ethical framework that could justify commerce and promote responsible business practices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ishida Baigan (石田梅岩, 1685-1744) and <em>Shingaku</em> (心学, Heart Learning):</strong> Baigan, the founder of <em>Shingaku</em>, sought to reconcile Confucian ethics with the realities of commercial life. He argued that merchants could contribute to society by providing goods and services, and that profit-making was not inherently immoral. <em>Shingaku</em> emphasized the importance of honesty, diligence, and frugality, and encouraged merchants to use their wealth for the benefit of others.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Justification of Commerce:</strong> <em>Shingaku</em> provided a moral framework for the merchant class, allowing them to participate in the economy without feeling guilty or ashamed. It helped to foster a sense of social responsibility among merchants and contributed to the development of Japanese business ethics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. <em>Sakoku</em>: The Ethics of Isolation</strong></p>
<p>The <em>sakoku</em> policy, implemented by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, severely restricted foreign trade and travel. This policy was motivated by a desire to maintain social stability, suppress the spread of Christianity, and protect Japan from foreign influence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolation as Protection:</strong> The shogunate justified <em>sakoku</em> as a necessary measure to protect Japan&rsquo;s unique culture and social order. By limiting contact with the outside world, they hoped to prevent the spread of disruptive ideas and maintain control over the population.</li>
<li><strong>Dutch Studies (<em>rangaku</em>, 蘭学):</strong> Despite <em>sakoku</em>, the shogunate allowed a small number of Dutch traders to operate in Nagasaki. This allowed some Japanese scholars to study Western science and technology through Dutch books and interactions with the Dutch. <em>Rangaku</em> (Dutch Studies) provided a window into the outside world and contributed to a growing awareness of Japan&rsquo;s relative backwardness.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Implications:</strong> <em>Sakoku</em> raised ethical questions about Japan&rsquo;s responsibility to the international community. While it may have been effective in maintaining domestic stability, it also isolated Japan from global developments and hindered its economic and technological progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Key Scholars</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Herman Ooms:</strong> <em>Tokugawa Ideology: Early Constructs, 1600-1680</em> (1985) and <em>Confucian Ethics and Tokugawa Discourse</em> (1996) provide a comprehensive analysis of the development of Neo-Confucianism in the Tokugawa period and its impact on Japanese society.</li>
<li><strong>Maruyama Masao:</strong> <em>Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan</em> (1974) explores the diverse intellectual currents of the Tokugawa period and their relationship to modernization.</li>
<li><strong>Tetsuo Najita:</strong> <em>Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan</em> (1987) examines the different ethical ideals that emerged in the Tokugawa period and their social and political implications.</li>
<li><strong>Harry Harootunian:</strong> <em>Things Seen and Unseen</em> (1988) analyzes the intellectual and cultural transformations of the Tokugawa period, focusing on the rise of new forms of consciousness and subjectivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tokugawa period was a crucial era in the development of Japanese ethical thought. The interplay of Neo-Confucianism, <em>bushido</em>, <em>kokugaku</em>, &ldquo;Japanese Enlightenment&rdquo; thinkers, and merchant ethics created a dynamic and often contradictory moral landscape. The legacy of Tokugawa ethics continues to shape Japanese society today, influencing attitudes towards authority, social responsibility, and the relationship between Japan and the world.</p>

<h2 id="meiji-transformation-and-imperial-ethics-modernization-to-militarism">Meiji Transformation and Imperial Ethics — Modernization to Militarism</h2>
<p>Here is an intellectual history of Japanese ethics from the Meiji Restoration through World War II (1868-1945), a period of immense transformation and ethical complexity.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Meiji Ethical Revolution and the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890)</strong></p>
<p>The Meiji Restoration (1868) marked Japan&rsquo;s rapid modernization and its entry onto the world stage. This era witnessed a deliberate construction of a new national identity, one that drew on selective interpretations of tradition while embracing Western advancements. The <em>Imperial Rescript on Education</em> (教育勅語, <em>Kyōiku Chokugo</em>) of 1890 became the cornerstone of this ethical project.</p>
<p>The <em>Rescript</em> was issued by Emperor Meiji and distributed to every school in the nation, to be recited at ceremonies. It outlined the moral virtues expected of Japanese citizens: filial piety, loyalty to the Emperor, marital fidelity, fraternal love, pursuit of learning, development of intellect, safeguarding morality, offering oneself to the State in times of emergency, and upholding the Constitution and laws.</p>
<p>The ethical framework of the <em>Rescript</em> can be understood as a fusion of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confucianism:</strong> Emphasizing filial piety (<em>kō</em>, 孝) and loyalty (<em>chū</em>, 忠) as the foundations of social order. The <em>Analects</em> (論語, <em>Rongo</em>) had long been a central text in Japanese education, and the <em>Rescript</em> reinforced these values within the context of the modern state.</li>
<li><strong>State Shinto:</strong> Linking the Emperor to a divine lineage and positioning him as the embodiment of the nation&rsquo;s spirit (<em>kokutai</em>, 国体). This drew upon the <em>Kojiki</em> (古事記, 712) and <em>Nihon Shoki</em> (日本書紀, 720), which were reinterpreted to emphasize the Emperor&rsquo;s unbroken line and sacred authority.</li>
<li><strong>Modernization Imperatives:</strong> Promoting the pursuit of learning and the development of intellect to strengthen the nation in the face of Western powers. This was framed as a patriotic duty, essential for Japan&rsquo;s survival and prosperity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Rescript</em> established a powerful ethical framework that prioritized national unity and obedience to the Emperor. It became a tool for instilling a sense of shared identity and purpose, but also for suppressing dissent and enforcing conformity.</p>
<p><strong>2. <em>Bunmei Kaika</em> (Civilization and Enlightenment) and Fukuzawa Yukichi</strong></p>
<p>The <em>bunmei kaika</em> (文明開化) movement, which began in the early Meiji period, involved the selective adoption of Western ideas and institutions. Fukuzawa Yukichi (福澤 諭吉, 1835-1901) was one of its leading proponents. In his influential work <em>An Encouragement of Learning</em> (学問のすすめ, <em>Gakumon no Susume</em>, 1872-1876), Fukuzawa argued that individual independence and rational inquiry were essential for national progress.</p>
<p>Fukuzawa advocated for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individualism:</strong> Challenging traditional Confucian hierarchies and promoting the idea of individual rights and responsibilities. He argued that people should be valued for their abilities and contributions, not their social status.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Learning:</strong> Emphasizing the importance of acquiring knowledge and skills that could be applied to solve real-world problems. He criticized the traditional Confucian focus on classical learning as impractical and irrelevant to modern life.</li>
<li><strong>National Independence:</strong> Promoting the idea of a strong and independent Japan that could compete with Western powers. He believed that modernization was essential for preserving Japan&rsquo;s sovereignty.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Fukuzawa embraced Western ideas, he also retained a strong sense of Japanese identity. He argued that Japan should adopt what was useful from the West while preserving its own unique culture and traditions. However, his emphasis on national strength and independence also laid the groundwork for future expansionism.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Meiji Constitution (1889) and <em>Kokutai</em></strong></p>
<p>The Meiji Constitution (大日本帝国憲法, <em>Dai Nippon Teikoku Kenpō</em>) of 1889 was modeled after the Prussian constitution and established a constitutional monarchy. However, it differed significantly from Western constitutional ethics in several key respects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emperor&rsquo;s Sovereignty:</strong> The Constitution declared that the Emperor was &ldquo;sacred and inviolable&rdquo; and held supreme authority. He was the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Rights:</strong> While the Constitution guaranteed certain rights and freedoms to citizens, these were subject to limitations imposed by law. The government had broad powers to restrict freedom of speech, assembly, and association in the name of national security.</li>
<li><strong><em>Kokutai</em> (National Polity/Essence):</strong> The concept of <em>kokutai</em> became central to Meiji-era ideology. It referred to the unique spiritual and cultural essence of Japan, embodied in the Emperor and the Japanese people. <em>Kokutai</em> was often invoked to justify policies that prioritized national unity and obedience to the state. It was deeply intertwined with State Shinto, reinforcing the idea of Japan as a divinely ordained nation with a special destiny.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Meiji Constitution established a system in which the Emperor held ultimate authority, and individual rights were subordinate to the needs of the state. This framework provided the legal and ideological basis for Japan&rsquo;s subsequent expansionist policies.</p>
<p><strong>4. Nishida Kitaro and the Kyoto School</strong></p>
<p>Nishida Kitaro (西田 幾多郎, 1870-1945) was Japan&rsquo;s most influential philosopher of the 20th century and founder of the Kyoto School. His philosophy sought to synthesize Western thought with Eastern, particularly Zen Buddhist, insights. Key concepts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Logic of Place (Basho):</strong> Nishida argued that reality is not a fixed substance but a dynamic field of relations. He used the concept of <em>basho</em> (場所, &ldquo;place&rdquo;) to describe this field, which he saw as both the ground of being and the source of all differentiation.</li>
<li><strong>Absolute Nothingness (Zettai Mu):</strong> Nishida drew on Zen Buddhism to develop the concept of <em>zettai mu</em> (絶対無, &ldquo;absolute nothingness&rdquo;). This is not simply the absence of being, but rather the dynamic and creative source from which all things arise.</li>
<li><strong>Action as Seeing:</strong> Nishida emphasized the importance of action in understanding reality. He argued that we come to know the world not through passive observation but through active engagement with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ethical implications of Nishida&rsquo;s philosophy are complex and contested. Some scholars argue that his emphasis on the dynamic and interconnected nature of reality could provide a basis for ethical responsibility and social justice. Others criticize his philosophy for its potential to be used to justify nationalism and militarism.</p>
<p>Tragically, some members of the Kyoto School, including Tanabe Hajime (田辺 元, 1885-1962) and Nishitani Keiji (西谷 啓治, 1900-1990), became entangled with wartime ideology. They developed philosophical justifications for Japan&rsquo;s expansionist policies, arguing that Japan had a unique mission to lead Asia and create a new world order. This highlights the dangers of abstract philosophical ideas being used to rationalize political violence.</p>
<p><strong>5. State Shinto and the Ethics of Empire</strong></p>
<p>State Shinto (国家神道, <em>Kokka Shintō</em>) was a system of state-sponsored religious practices that emerged during the Meiji period. It promoted the idea of the Emperor as a divine figure and emphasized the importance of ancestor worship and national loyalty.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emperor as Divine:</strong> The Meiji government promoted the idea that the Emperor was a direct descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu (天照大神), as recounted in the <em>Kojiki</em> and <em>Nihon Shoki</em>. This reinforced his authority and made him the focus of national devotion.</li>
<li><strong>Yasukuni Shrine:</strong> The Yasukuni Shrine (靖国神社) was established in 1869 to commemorate those who had died in service of the Emperor. It became a symbol of national sacrifice and a focal point for wartime propaganda. Controversially, it includes the names of convicted war criminals, blurring the lines between patriotism and aggression.</li>
<li><strong>Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere:</strong> The concept of the &ldquo;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&rdquo; (大東亜共栄圏, <em>Dai Tōa Kyōeiken</em>) was used to justify Japan&rsquo;s expansionist policies in Asia. It presented Japan as the leader of a unified Asia, liberating the region from Western colonialism and creating a new economic and political order. This was, in reality, a mask for Japanese imperialism, involving the exploitation and subjugation of other Asian countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>State Shinto played a crucial role in mobilizing the Japanese population for war. It instilled a sense of national purpose and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for the Emperor and the nation.</p>
<p><strong>6. Wartime Atrocities and Ethical Failure</strong></p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s wartime conduct was marked by numerous atrocities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Nanjing Massacre (1937):</strong> The Rape of Nanking (南京事件, <em>Nankin Jiken</em>) involved the mass murder of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war by Japanese troops. Estimates of the death toll range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li><strong>Comfort Women:</strong> The forced sexual enslavement of women from Korea, China, the Philippines, and other countries by the Japanese military.</li>
<li><strong>Unit 731:</strong> A secret biological and chemical warfare research unit that conducted experiments on human subjects, including prisoners of war and civilians.</li>
<li><strong>POW Treatment:</strong> Japanese treatment of prisoners of war was notoriously brutal, with high rates of death and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>These atrocities represent a profound ethical failure. They raise fundamental questions about the nature of wartime morality, the responsibility of individuals and institutions, and the legacy of historical trauma.</p>
<p>Tanabe Hajime, reflecting on his own complicity with wartime ideology, developed a &ldquo;Philosophy of Metanoetics&rdquo; (懺悔道としての哲学, <em>Zange Michi toshite no Tetsugaku</em>, 1946). <em>Metanoia</em> (悔い改め) is a Greek term for repentance and transformation. Tanabe argued that philosophy should be a process of self-reflection and repentance, aimed at overcoming one&rsquo;s own egoism and complicity in evil. While Tanabe&rsquo;s work is a significant attempt to grapple with the ethical failures of the wartime period, some critics argue that it does not go far enough in acknowledging the systemic nature of the atrocities and the need for collective responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>7. Key Scholars</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maruyama Masao (丸山 眞男, 1914-1996):</strong> <em>Thought and Behaviour in Modern Japanese Politics</em> (1963) examines the structures of thought that enabled Japanese militarism. He analyzed the patterns of &ldquo;thought and behavior&rdquo; (思想と行動, <em>shisō to kōdō</em>) that led to the rise of authoritarianism and the suppression of individual freedom.</li>
<li><strong>John Dower:</strong> <em>War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War</em> (1986) explores the racial stereotypes and dehumanization that fueled the Pacific War.</li>
<li><strong>Andrew Gordon:</strong> <em>A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present</em> (2019) provides a comprehensive overview of modern Japanese history, including the ethical dimensions of the Meiji Restoration, the rise of militarism, and the postwar period.</li>
</ul>
<p>The period from the Meiji Restoration to the end of World War II was a time of profound ethical transformation in Japan. The nation underwent rapid modernization, embraced Western ideas, and constructed a new national identity centered on the Emperor and the <em>kokutai</em>. However, this process also led to the rise of militarism, expansionism, and ultimately, devastating wartime atrocities. The legacy of this period continues to shape Japanese society and its relationship with the world. Ethical reflection on this era is crucial for understanding Japan&rsquo;s past and building a more just and peaceful future.</p>

<p><strong>Text:</strong> “Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes…land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.” (日本国憲法第9条, enacted 3 May 1947)</p>
<p><strong>Authorship Debate:</strong> The initial draft was prepared by the Government Section of SCAP under General MacArthur (1946), with significant contributions from <strong>Beate Sirota Gordon</strong> (women’s rights articles) and <strong>Milton Esman</strong>. However, the ethical weight derives from its <strong>domestic ratification</strong> by the Imperial Diet and its embrace by the Japanese public, particularly war-weary citizens and progressive intellectuals.</p>
<p><strong>Imposed or Embraced?</strong> While externally prompted, Article 9 was internalized through:
- <strong>Unofficial constitutional theory</strong> (非公式憲法理論) of <strong>Maruyama Masao</strong>, who argued it represented a revolutionary break from the emperor-centered <em>kokutai</em> (国体) and embodied popular sovereignty.
- The <strong>Peace Preservation Law</strong> replacement: The 1952 <strong>Subversive Activities Prevention Act</strong> (破壊活動防止法) framed pacifism as a civic duty.

<h2 id="7-ai-and-robot-ethics-from-astro-boy-to-society-50">7. AI and Robot Ethics: From Astro Boy to Society 5.0</h2>
<p><strong>Cultural Foundations:</strong><br />
- <strong>1952–68:</strong> <strong>Tezuka Osamu</strong>’s <strong>鉄腕アトム</strong> (<em>Astro Boy</em>) established <strong>robot as compassionate companion</strong> (友, <em>tomo</em>).<br />

<hr />
<h2 id="8-key-scholars-and-their-ethical-frameworks">8. Key Scholars and Their Ethical Frameworks</h2>
<p><strong>Maruyama Masao</strong> (1914–1996):<br />
- <strong>1946:</strong> <strong>「超国家主義の論理と心理」</strong> (“Logic and Psychology of Ultranationalism”) diagnosed prewar ethical failure as <em>shutaisei</em> (主体性, subjectivity) deficit.<br />
- <strong>1961:</strong> <strong>「日本の思想」</strong> (<em>Japanese Thought</em>) argued Article 9 enabled democratic <em>kokumin</em> (国民, nation-people) ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Karatani Kojin</strong> (b. 1941):<br />
- <strong>2004:</strong> <strong>「世界共和国へ」</strong> (<em>Transcritique</em>) re-read Article 9 as <strong>ethical resistance to nation-state system</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ueno Chizuko</strong> (b. 1948):<br />
- <strong>1990:</strong> <strong>「近代家族の成立と終焉」</strong> (<em>The Modern Family: Its Rise and Fall</em>) critiqued <strong>ie</strong> (家) system as source of gender harm.<br />
- <strong>2021:</strong> <strong>「ケアの社会学」</strong> (<em>Sociology of Care</em>) advocates <strong>care ethics</strong> against productivityism.</p>
<p><strong>Oguma Eiji</strong> (b. 1962):<br />
- <strong>2002:</strong> <strong>「「民主」と「愛国」」</strong> (<em>Democracy and Patriotism</em>) traced postwar ethical contradictions through grassroots movements.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-an-ethics-of-fragile-balance">Conclusion: An Ethics of Fragile Balance</h2>
<p>Postwar Japanese ethics navigates <strong>irreconcilable tensions</strong>: pacifism vs. security, growth vs. environment, loyalty vs. individuality. The <strong>Heisei</strong> (1989–2019) and <strong>Reiwa</strong> eras reveal a society grappling with what <strong>Karatani</strong> calls <strong>「定常状態の倫理」</strong> (“ethics of steady-state”)—no longer miracle-driven but seeking care-based frameworks. Yet <strong>Article 9 revision pressures</strong>, <strong>Fukushima legacy</strong>, and <strong>AI governance challenges</strong> test whether Japan’s ethical thought can sustain its humanistic traditions amid 21st-century crises.</p>

### Japanese Ethical Thought During the Tokugawa Period (1603-1868)

The Tokugawa period was a transformative era in Japanese intellectual history, marked by the consolidation of Neo-Confucian state ideology, the codification of warrior ethics, and the emergence of diverse ethical frameworks that challenged orthodoxy. Below, I address the key developments and tensions in Tokugawa ethical thought.

### 1. Neo-Confucian Ethics as State Ideology
**Hayashi Razan (1583-1657)** played a pivotal role in the official adoption of **Zhu Xi Confucianism** (朱子学, *Shushigaku*) as the Tokugawa state ideology. Razan argued that Neo-Confucian principles—particularly the **Great Learning** (*Da Xue*) and **Doctrine of the Mean** (*Zhong Yong*)—provided a moral foundation for social order. The Tokugawa shogunate institutionalized a **four-class system** (*shi-no-ko-sho*: warrior, farmer, artisan, merchant), justified through Confucian ethics:
- **Li** (理, *ri*): The principle governing cosmic and social order.
- **Hierarchy**: Each class had a designated role (*shokubun*) contributing to societal harmony.
- **Filial piety** (孝, *kō*) and **loyalty** (忠, *chū*) were emphasized as ethical pillars.

However, this rigid hierarchy created tensions, particularly for the rising merchant class, whose wealth often exceeded their social status.

### 2. Bushido: The Way of the Warrior
**Bushido** (武士道, "the way of the warrior") was codified during Tokugawa Japan, emphasizing martial virtue and loyalty. Its interpretations varied:
- **Yamamoto Tsunetomo's *Hagakure* (1716)**: "The way of the warrior is death." Tsunetomo's extreme version glorified self-sacrifice and blind loyalty to one's lord.
- **Yamaga Soko (1622-1685)**: Soko's *Buke Shohatto* (Rules for the Military Houses) offered a more balanced view, emphasizing **righteousness** (義, *gi*) alongside loyalty. He argued that samurai should serve as moral exemplars.

The **Forty-Seven Ronin incident** (1701-1703) exemplifies the tension between *chu* (loyalty) and *gi* (righteousness). While the ronin’s revenge was celebrated, it also raised ethical questions about vengeance and law.

### 3. Kokugaku (National Learning)
**Kokugaku** (国学) scholars like **Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801)** and **Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843)** sought to recover indigenous Shinto ethics by rejecting Buddhist and Confucian influence:
- **Motoori Norinaga**: In *Kojiki-den* (1798), Norinaga emphasized *mono no aware* (物の哀れ, the pathos of things) and the purity of Japanese culture. Ethics arose from an intuitive understanding of the divine (*kami*).
- **Hirata Atsutane**: Atsutane’s *Koshiden* (1812) framed Shinto as the source of Japanese uniqueness, laying the groundwork for later nationalism.

Kokugaku ethics prioritized intuitive, emotional responsiveness over abstract moral principles, influencing later imperial ideologies.

### 4. Tokugawa Enlightenment Thinkers
Several thinkers critiqued Neo-Confucian orthodoxy:
- **Ogyu Sorai (1666-1728)**: In *Bendo* (Distinguishing the Way, 1717), Sorai argued that Confucian ethics should focus on practical governance rather than abstract principles.
- **Ito Jinsai (1627-1705)**: In *Gomo Jigi* (Meanings of Terms in the Analects and Mencius, 1705), Jinsai emphasized *ren* (仁, humaneness) as the core of Confucian ethics.
- **Ando Shoeki (1703-1762)**: Shoeki’s *Shizen shin’eido* (The True Way of Nature) advocated radical egalitarianism, condemning the class system and private property as unnatural.

These thinkers challenged Tokugawa orthodoxy, advocating for more humane and practical ethical systems.

### 5. Merchant Class Ethics: Ishida Baigan and Shingaku
**Ishida Baigan (1685-1744)** founded **Shingaku** (Heart Learning), a moral philosophy for the merchant class. In *Tohi Mondo* (The Dialogue between City and Country, 1729), Baigan argued that commerce was a virtuous activity when aligned with Confucian principles:
- **Honesty** (信, *shin*) and **integrity** were essential for business ethics.
- Merchants could achieve self-cultivation (*shugyo*) through their work.

Shingaku legitimized commerce, providing an ethical framework for Japan’s emerging capitalist class.

### 6. Sakoku (Closed Country) as Ethical Framework
Tokugawa Japan’s policy of **sakoku** (鎖国, "closed country") was justified as a means of protecting Japanese society from foreign influence:
- **Ethics of Isolation**: Isolation preserved social order (*wa*), preventing cultural and ethical contamination.
- **Dutch Studies (rangaku)**: Despite sakoku, the Dutch Nagasaki trading post allowed limited contact, fostering the study of Western science and medicine. Thinkers like **Sugita Genpaku (1733-1817)** translated Western texts, challenging traditional assumptions.

Sakoku’s ethics of protection clashed with the growing curiosity about foreign ideas.

### 7. Key Scholars and Interpretations
- **Herman Ooms**: In *Tokugawa Village Practice* (1996), Ooms examines how Neo-Confucian ethics were localized in village life.
- **Maruyama Masao**: In *Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan* (1974), Maruyama traces the emergence of modern thought from Tokugawa critiques of orthodoxy.
- **Tetsuo Najita**: Najita’s *Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan* (1987) explores the ethical frameworks of merchant intellectuals like Ishida Baigan.
- **Harry Harootunian**: In *Things Seen and Unseen* (1988), Harootunian analyzes Kokugaku’s role in shaping modern Japanese nationalism.

### Conclusion
Tokugawa Japan was a crucible of ethical thought, marked by the interplay of Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, warrior ethics, indigenous Shinto recovery, and Enlightenment critiques. These diverse traditions laid the groundwork for Japan’s modern intellectual and moral landscape, even as they contained tensions that would later erupt in the Meiji era.

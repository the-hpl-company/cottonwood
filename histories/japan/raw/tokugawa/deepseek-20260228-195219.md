## **Tokugawa Japan (1603–1868): Ethics in the Closed World**

The Tokugawa period, an era of *Pax Tokugawa* enforced by the *bakuhan* system, witnessed the systematic codification of social ethics amid rigid stability. This was not a monolithic ethical landscape but a contested field where state orthodoxy, warrior ethos, nativist revival, and heterodox critiques clashed and intertwined.

### **1. Neo-Confucian Ethics as State Ideology**
The Tokugawa shogunate, seeking a philosophical foundation for social order beyond military might, officially patronized the Zhu Xi school of Neo-Confucianism (*Shushigaku*). **Hayashi Razan (1583–1657)**, a key architect, served as scholarly advisor to the first shoguns. He argued that Zhu Xi’s metaphysics provided a natural, hierarchical order for Japan.

*   **Core Ethical Framework:** Razan adapted the Chinese *Great Learning* (*Daigaku*) concept of "investigating things" (*kakubutsu*) and "extending knowledge" (*chichi*) to justify a fixed social hierarchy. The universe was governed by **Principle** (*ri*) manifesting in differentiated **material force** (*ki*), creating an immutable natural order.
*   **Social Application – The Four-Class System (*shi-no-ko-sho*):** This system (samurai, peasants, artisans, merchants) was ethically justified as a reflection of cosmic principle. Each class had its inherent *ri* and corresponding duties (*giri*). Samurai, as the ruling class, were to cultivate virtue (*tokugi*) and benevolence (*jin*); peasants, closest to the foundational economy, were to be productive; artisans and merchants, seen as potentially disruptive due to profit-seeking, were to be frugal and honest within their station.
*   **Key Text:** Razan's commentaries, such as his *Notes on the Four Books* (*Shisho chūsho*), became standard for samurai education. The **Kansei Reforms (1787-1793)** later banned "heterodox studies" (*igaku*), cementing Zhu Xi Confucianism as the sole orthodox learning (*seigaku*) of the state academy.

### **2. Bushido: The Contested Way of the Warrior**
*Bushidō* was not a unified code but a diverse discourse on samurai ethics, sharpened by the paradox of a warrior class in an era of peace.

*   **Yamaga Sokō (1622–1685):** In works like *The Way of the Samurai* (*Shidō*), he articulated a "samurai as civil servant" ethos. The samurai's function was moral leadership: to study, administer justly, and embody *jin* (benevolence) and *gi* (righteousness). His was a Confucian-infused, civic-minded bushidō.
*   **Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659–1719) – *Hagakure* (1716):** This text represents the extreme, existential pole. Its infamous opening, **「武士道と云ふは死ぬ事と見付けたり」** ("*Bushidō to iu wa, shinu koto to mitsuketari*" – "I have found that the Way of the Samurai is death"), advocates a radical, aestheticized embrace of death and absolute loyalty to one's immediate lord, even against reason or broader morality. It prioritizes *chū* (loyalty) as an act of pure will.
*   **The Forty-Seven Rōnin Incident (1701-1703) – *Chūshingura*:** This event became Japan's paramount ethical case study. The tension between **忠 *chū*** (loyalty to Lord Asano) and **義 *gi*** (righteousness in the eyes of the shogunate, which had forbidden vendettas) was unresolvable. The rōnin chose *chū*, executed their vengeance, and were ordered to commit seppuku for violating shogunal law. The incident was debated for centuries: was it the ultimate act of bushidō or a criminal challenge to state authority? Scholar **Herman Ooms** (*Tokugawa Ideology*, 1985) argues it exposed the fundamental conflict between feudal loyalty and the state's need for a transcendent law.

### **3. Kokugaku (National Learning): A Shinto Ethical Recovery**
Reacting against Buddhist otherworldliness and Confucian rationalism, *Kokugaku* scholars sought to recover a pristine Japanese ethic from ancient texts like the *Kojiki* (712) and *Man'yōshū* (8th century).

*   **Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801):** His monumental 44-volume *Commentary on the Kojiki* (*Kojiki-den*) aimed to strip Chinese interpretations from Japanese myth. He located ethics in the **「もののあはれ」 *mono no aware*** – a deep, empathetic sensitivity to the poignant beauty and sorrow of the world, cultivated through literary study. For Norinaga, the Japanese heart (*yamato gokoro*) was naturally sincere and harmonious, unlike the "Chinese mind" (*kara gokoro*) obsessed with artificial moral constructs.
*   **Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843):** Radicalized Kokugaku into a populist, nationalist creed. In works like *The August Pillar of the Soul* (*Tama no mihashira*), he posited a native afterlife (*yomi*) and argued that all Japanese, as descendants of the *kami*, were connected by blood to the Emperor. This created an **ethnic-ethical community** bound by filial piety to the imperial line. As **Harry Harootunian** (*Things Seen and Unseen*, 1988) notes, Hirata’s thought directly fed into late Tokugawa anti-foreign sentiment and the *sonnō jōi* ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians") movement.

### **4. Enlightenment and Heterodox Critiques**
Within the Confucian framework, powerful critiques emerged.

*   **Itō Jinsai (1627–1705):** Founded the *Kogigaku* (School of Ancient Meanings). In *The Meaning of Terms in the Analects and Mencius* (*Gomō jigi*), he rejected Zhu Xi's abstract *ri*, arguing that the core Confucian virtue was **仁 *jin* (humaneness)** – a dynamic, relational love between people, rooted in everyday life.
*   **Ogyū Sorai (1666–1728):** A more radical historicist. In *Distinguishing the Way* (*Bendō*) and *Distinguishing Names* (*Benmei*), he argued that the Confucian "Way" was not a natural principle but a **sagely invention** – a set of rites, music, and laws created by ancient kings to order society. This made ethics political and utilitarian, undermining the Neo-Confucian naturalized hierarchy. Scholar **Maruyama Masao** (*Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan*, 1974) saw Sorai as the foundational modern thinker who separated political norms from natural law.
*   **Andō Shōeki (c. 1703-1762):** The most radical. In *The True Doctrine of Natural Living* (*Shizen shin'eidō*), he attacked all class society, Buddhism, and Confucianism as unnatural "laws of the sages" that created hierarchy and exploitation. He envisioned a society of **"直耕 *jikkyō*"** (direct cultivation), where all people farmed equally, governed by a spontaneous "natural world" ethic. His was a profound, if isolated, argument for egalitarianism.

### **5. Merchant Class Ethics: Shingaku (Heart Learning)**
With the rise of an urban merchant (*chōnin*) culture, a distinct commercial ethic was needed.

*   **Ishida Baigan (1685-1744):** Founder of *Shingaku*. He synthesized Confucian, Shinto, and Buddhist ideas to argue that the **merchant's profit was his "virtue"** – the just reward for diligent labor and honest dealing. In *City and Country Dialogues* (*Tohi mondō*), he taught that the "way of the merchant" (*shōnindō*) was a legitimate path to moral cultivation through frugality, diligence, and sincerity (*makoto*). The merchant served society by facilitating exchange.
*   **Ethical Framework:** Shingaku internalized ethics as "knowing one's heart" and fulfilling one's occupational duty (*bushō*). As scholar **Tetsuo Najita** (*Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan*, 1987) demonstrates, this gave the merchant class a dignified, **this-worldly asceticism** comparable to the Protestant work ethic, justifying accumulation while curbing extravagance.

### **6. Sakoku as Ethical Framework**
The *Sakoku* ("closed country") policy (c. 1633-1853) was not merely strategic; it had an ethical dimension.

*   **Isolation as Protection:** The regime framed isolation as protecting the Japanese "body politic" from the spiritual harm of Christianity (*bateren*) and the political disruption of foreign influence. It was a form of **paternalistic stewardship**, preserving the *kokutai* (national polity) and its Confucian-Shinto moral order.
*   **The Crack: Rangaku (Dutch Studies):** The tiny window at Nagasaki's Dejima island allowed for *rangaku*. Scholars like **Sugita Genpaku (1733-1817)**, who translated *Kaitai Shinsho* (1774, a Dutch anatomy text), demonstrated that Western empirical science could yield valid knowledge. This created a fundamental tension: the ethical duty to preserve the closed order versus the intellectual duty to pursue truth, however foreign. By the late 18th century, *rangaku* scholars like **Honda Toshiaki (1744-1821)** began to argue that isolation itself was unethical, leaving Japan vulnerable and backward.

### **7. Synthesis: The Ethical Crucible**
The Tokugawa period was an ethical crucible where:
*   **Orthodoxy (Neo-Confucianism)** provided a stable, hierarchical social ethic.
*   **Internal Critique (Bushidō variants, Sorai, Jinsai)** debated the meaning of loyalty, virtue, and political authority.
*   **Counter-Ideology (Kokugaku)** constructed a nativist, emotive ethic that would later fuel nationalism.
*   **Popular Ethics (Shingaku)** adapted tradition to justify emerging economic realities.
*   **External Pressure (Rangaku)** slowly corroded the ethical premise of isolation.

This intense intellectual fermentation within a closed system set the stage for the explosive ethical and political transformations of the Meiji Restoration. The Tokugawa legacy is one of profound ethical codification and equally profound ethical contestation, all under the enforced peace of the *bakufu*.

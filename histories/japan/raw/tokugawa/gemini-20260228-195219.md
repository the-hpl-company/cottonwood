## Tokugawa Ethics: Harmony, Hierarchy, and Heresy (1603-1868)

The Tokugawa period (1603-1868) in Japan was a time of enforced peace under the *bakufu* (shogunate), a rigid social hierarchy, and a complex interplay of ethical frameworks. While Neo-Confucianism served as the official ideology, other schools of thought – *bushido*, *kokugaku*, "Japanese Enlightenment" thinkers, and merchant ethics – offered alternative perspectives, creating a dynamic and often contradictory moral landscape. The policy of *sakoku* (national seclusion) further shaped ethical considerations related to self-reliance, cultural purity, and interactions with the outside world.

**1. Neo-Confucianism as State Ideology:**

The Tokugawa shogunate, seeking to stabilize its rule, embraced Neo-Confucianism, specifically the teachings of Zhu Xi (Shushi, 朱熹, 1130-1200), as its official ideology. Hayashi Razan (林羅山, 1583-1657), a prominent scholar, played a key role in adapting Zhu Xi's philosophy to the Japanese context. Razan argued for a hierarchical social order based on the "four classes" (*shi-no-ko-sho*, 士農工商): samurai (warriors), farmers, artisans, and merchants. This system, borrowed from Chinese thought, was justified through Confucian principles of social harmony and the idea that each class had a specific role to play in maintaining the well-being of society.

*   **Hayashi Razan's *Razan Sensei Bunshu***: This collection of Razan's writings articulates the Confucian basis for social hierarchy, emphasizing the importance of filial piety (*ko*, 孝) and loyalty (*chu*, 忠) to one's superiors. The samurai, as the ruling class, were expected to embody these virtues, serving as moral exemplars for the rest of society.
*   **Impact:** Neo-Confucianism provided a framework for legitimizing the shogunate's rule and reinforcing social stability. Education was standardized along Neo-Confucian lines, with the establishment of schools like the *Shoheiko* (昌平黌) in Edo. This led to the widespread dissemination of Confucian values, shaping the ethical consciousness of the samurai class and influencing other social groups. However, the rigid social hierarchy also created resentment and social tensions, particularly among the lower classes.

**2. *Bushido*: The Way of the Warrior**

*Bushido* (武士道, the way of the warrior) was a complex and evolving ethical code for the samurai class. It emphasized virtues such as loyalty, courage, honor, and self-sacrifice. While often romanticized in later narratives, *bushido* in the Tokugawa period was a pragmatic set of guidelines for maintaining social order and upholding the samurai's status.

*   **Yamamoto Tsunetomo's *Hagakure* (葉隠, 1716):** This text, dictated by Yamamoto Tsunetomo (山本常朝, 1659-1719), a former samurai of the Saga domain, presents a radical view of *bushido*. The famous line, "The way of the warrior is death," reflects the idea that a samurai should be willing to die for his lord without hesitation. *Hagakure* emphasizes unwavering loyalty, even to the point of irrationality, and encourages a constant awareness of death to overcome fear and self-interest.
*   **Yamaga Soko (山鹿素行, 1622-1685):** Soko offered a more measured approach to *bushido*, emphasizing the samurai's role as a moral leader and scholar. He advocated for a combination of martial skills and Confucian learning, arguing that the samurai should be a model of ethical conduct for the rest of society.
*   **The Forty-Seven Ronin (元禄赤穂事件, Genroku Ako Incident, 1701-1703):** This event became a defining ethical case study in Japanese history. After their lord, Asano Naganori, was forced to commit suicide for drawing his sword in Edo Castle, his retainers became *ronin* (masterless samurai). They plotted revenge against Kira Yoshinaka, the official who had provoked Asano. After two years of planning, the *ronin* successfully assassinated Kira and then surrendered to the authorities. The shogunate, faced with a difficult dilemma, ultimately ordered the *ronin* to commit *seppuku* (ritual suicide).

    *   **Ethical Debate:** The Forty-Seven Ronin raised complex questions about loyalty (*chu*) versus righteousness (*gi*), revenge versus justice, and the individual's duty to the state. While their loyalty to their lord was widely admired, their act of revenge violated the law and challenged the authority of the shogunate. The story of the Forty-Seven Ronin became a powerful symbol of *bushido* ideals, but also highlighted the inherent tensions within the samurai ethic.

**3. *Kokugaku*: National Learning**

The *Kokugaku* (国学, National Learning) school emerged as a reaction against the perceived dominance of Chinese thought, particularly Confucianism and Buddhism. *Kokugaku* scholars sought to recover and celebrate indigenous Japanese traditions, focusing on ancient texts like the *Kojiki* (古事記, Record of Ancient Matters, 712) and the *Nihon Shoki* (日本書紀, Chronicles of Japan, 720).

*   **Motoori Norinaga (本居宣長, 1730-1801):** A leading figure in *Kokugaku*, Norinaga emphasized the concept of *mono no aware* (物の哀れ), a sensitivity to the beauty and pathos of the world. He criticized Confucianism for its emphasis on reason and morality, arguing that it suppressed natural human emotions. Norinaga believed that true Japanese virtue lay in embracing these emotions and living in accordance with the natural order.
*   **Hirata Atsutane (平田篤胤, 1776-1843):** Atsutane further radicalized *Kokugaku*, advocating for a revival of Shinto and the expulsion of foreign influences. He promoted a vision of Japan as a divinely ordained nation with a unique spiritual essence. Atsutane's ideas contributed to the rise of ultranationalism in the late Tokugawa and Meiji periods.
*   **Ethical Framework:** *Kokugaku* promoted an ethical framework based on the idea of *makoto* (真), sincerity or purity of heart. This involved living in accordance with one's natural feelings and respecting the ancient traditions of Japan. *Kokugaku* also emphasized the importance of loyalty to the emperor, whom it viewed as a descendant of the gods.

**4. Japanese Enlightenment Thinkers**

While Neo-Confucianism dominated official discourse, several thinkers challenged its orthodoxy and offered alternative ethical visions. These "Japanese Enlightenment" thinkers questioned traditional authority and advocated for more rational and humane approaches to governance and social life.

*   **Ogyu Sorai (荻生徂徠, 1666-1728):** Sorai criticized Zhu Xi Confucianism for its abstract moralizing and its failure to address the practical needs of society. He argued that the true purpose of Confucianism was to provide a framework for effective governance. Sorai advocated for a return to the original teachings of Confucius and emphasized the importance of studying the historical context of the Confucian classics.
*   **Ito Jinsai (伊藤仁斎, 1627-1705):** Jinsai emphasized the importance of *ren* (仁, humaneness), arguing that it was the foundation of all virtues. He criticized Zhu Xi Confucianism for its emphasis on abstract principles, arguing that it neglected the importance of cultivating compassion and empathy.
*   **Ando Shoeki (安藤昌益, 1703-1762):** Shoeki was a radical social critic who advocated for a utopian society based on equality and communal ownership of land. He condemned the existing social hierarchy and the exploitation of farmers by the ruling class. Shoeki's ideas were far ahead of his time and had little immediate impact, but he is now recognized as one of the most original and radical thinkers in Japanese history. His surviving work is the *Shizen Shin'eido* (自然真営道, The Natural Way of Farming)

**5. Merchant Class Ethics: *Shingaku***

The rise of a wealthy merchant class in the Tokugawa period challenged the traditional social hierarchy and created a need for a new ethical framework that could justify commerce and promote responsible business practices.

*   **Ishida Baigan (石田梅岩, 1685-1744) and *Shingaku* (心学, Heart Learning):** Baigan, the founder of *Shingaku*, sought to reconcile Confucian ethics with the realities of commercial life. He argued that merchants could contribute to society by providing goods and services, and that profit-making was not inherently immoral. *Shingaku* emphasized the importance of honesty, diligence, and frugality, and encouraged merchants to use their wealth for the benefit of others.
*   **Ethical Justification of Commerce:** *Shingaku* provided a moral framework for the merchant class, allowing them to participate in the economy without feeling guilty or ashamed. It helped to foster a sense of social responsibility among merchants and contributed to the development of Japanese business ethics.

**6. *Sakoku*: The Ethics of Isolation**

The *sakoku* policy, implemented by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, severely restricted foreign trade and travel. This policy was motivated by a desire to maintain social stability, suppress the spread of Christianity, and protect Japan from foreign influence.

*   **Isolation as Protection:** The shogunate justified *sakoku* as a necessary measure to protect Japan's unique culture and social order. By limiting contact with the outside world, they hoped to prevent the spread of disruptive ideas and maintain control over the population.
*   **Dutch Studies (*rangaku*, 蘭学):** Despite *sakoku*, the shogunate allowed a small number of Dutch traders to operate in Nagasaki. This allowed some Japanese scholars to study Western science and technology through Dutch books and interactions with the Dutch. *Rangaku* (Dutch Studies) provided a window into the outside world and contributed to a growing awareness of Japan's relative backwardness.
*   **Ethical Implications:** *Sakoku* raised ethical questions about Japan's responsibility to the international community. While it may have been effective in maintaining domestic stability, it also isolated Japan from global developments and hindered its economic and technological progress.

**7. Key Scholars**

*   **Herman Ooms:** *Tokugawa Ideology: Early Constructs, 1600-1680* (1985) and *Confucian Ethics and Tokugawa Discourse* (1996) provide a comprehensive analysis of the development of Neo-Confucianism in the Tokugawa period and its impact on Japanese society.
*   **Maruyama Masao:** *Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan* (1974) explores the diverse intellectual currents of the Tokugawa period and their relationship to modernization.
*   **Tetsuo Najita:** *Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan* (1987) examines the different ethical ideals that emerged in the Tokugawa period and their social and political implications.
*   **Harry Harootunian:** *Things Seen and Unseen* (1988) analyzes the intellectual and cultural transformations of the Tokugawa period, focusing on the rise of new forms of consciousness and subjectivity.

The Tokugawa period was a crucial era in the development of Japanese ethical thought. The interplay of Neo-Confucianism, *bushido*, *kokugaku*, "Japanese Enlightenment" thinkers, and merchant ethics created a dynamic and often contradictory moral landscape. The legacy of Tokugawa ethics continues to shape Japanese society today, influencing attitudes towards authority, social responsibility, and the relationship between Japan and the world.

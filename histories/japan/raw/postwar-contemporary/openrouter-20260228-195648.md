### 1. **Article 9 of the Constitution (1947) — The Ethical Commitment to Peace**
Article 9, which renounces war and prohibits Japan from maintaining armed forces, was drafted during the Allied Occupation under General Douglas MacArthur. Beate Sirota Gordon, a young American of Austrian-Jewish descent, played a key role in drafting the gender equality provisions but not Article 9. The authorship remains debated—whether it was MacArthur’s vision or influenced by Japanese pacifists like Shidehara Kijūrō. Regardless, Article 9 has been embraced as a moral commitment to peace *hedatarazu* (“not by force”). Despite ongoing debates over revision—fueled by security concerns, notably North Korea’s nuclear capabilities—Japan has maintained Article 9 as a cornerstone of its postwar identity. Prime Minister Abe Shinzō’s reinterpretation (2014) to allow limited collective self-defense sparked widespread protests, reflecting deep public attachment to its ethical ideal.

### 2. **Hiroshima and Nagasaki — Hibakusha as Ethical Voices**
The atomic bombings (August 6 and 9, 1945) became ethical touchstones for Japan. Hibakusha (survivors) like Yamahata Shōmei and Sasaki Sadako (symbolized by her paper cranes) transformed personal suffering into global anti-nuclear advocacy. Organizations like *Nihon Hidankyō* (Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations) have lobbied for disarmament, influencing international treaties like the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (2017). Japan’s *Three Non-Nuclear Principles* (1967) — no possession, no production, no introduction — reflect this ethical stance, though the U.S. nuclear umbrella complicates this commitment.

### 3. **The Economic Miracle (1955-1991) — Corporate Ethics and Karoshi**
Postwar Japan’s economic miracle was built on ethical ideals of collective obligation: *shūshin koyō* (lifetime employment), *kaizen* (continuous improvement), and *ningen kankei* (human relations). The *salaryman* embodied corporate loyalty but at great cost: *karoshi* (death from overwork), first officially recognized in 1987, exposed the dark side of this ethic. The Labour Standards Act (1947) and subsequent reforms aimed to protect workers but often failed to address systemic pressures. Feminist scholars like Ueno Chizuko critiqued the gendered division of labor, where women bore the burden of *kaji rōdō* (domestic labor) while men worked endless hours.

### 4. **Minamata Disease (1956-) — Environmental Ethics and Corporate Accountability**
Minamata disease, caused by mercury poisoning from Chisso Corporation’s wastewater, became a landmark in Japanese environmental ethics. Chisso’s cover-up and government complicity epitomized corporate negligence. Photographer W. Eugene Smith’s *Minamata* series (1971-73) brought global attention to victims’ suffering. This tragedy led to stricter environmental laws, including the Basic Environmental Law (1993), and inspired grassroots movements like *Shimin Undō* (citizen activism). It reshaped Japanese society’s understanding of *kankyō hogo* (environmental protection) and corporate responsibility.

### 5. **The Lost Decades (1991-) — Ethics of Disillusionment**
The collapse of Japan’s bubble economy shattered the postwar social contract. Unemployment, precarity, and *hinkon* (poverty) rose, leading to ethical disillusionment. *Hikikomori* (social withdrawal, now affecting over 1 million Japanese) and the declining birth rate (falling below 800,000 births in 2022) reflect a crisis of collective purpose. Philosopher Karatani Kojin argues that Japan’s postwar ethic of *kokumin* (national citizenry) has been replaced by atomized individualism. The government’s response, such as the New Economic Policy (2012) under *Abenomics*, has struggled to restore trust.

### 6. **Fukushima (2011) — Nuclear Ethics and Technological Risk**
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, triggered by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, forced Japan to confront its nuclear trauma. The government’s mishandling of the crisis eroded public trust in institutions. Despite widespread anti-nuclear sentiment, Japan resumed nuclear power operations in 2015, citing energy security. This tension reflects the ethical dilemma of balancing technological progress (*gijutsu shinkō*) with the *mujō* (impermanence) of human control over nature.

### 7. **Contemporary Japanese Ethics and AI — Society 5.0**
Japan’s approach to AI emphasizes harmony (*wa*) and *jidōka* (automation with a human touch). The development of the supercomputer Fugaku (2020) and initiatives like Society 5.0 reflect a vision of AI as enhancing human welfare, not replacing it. This contrasts with Western AI ethics focused on individual rights and Chinese AI geared toward state surveillance. Japan’s robot ethics tradition, influenced by *Astro Boy* (1952) and Mori Masahiro’s *The Buddha in the Robot* (1974), views AI as *ningen rashii* (human-like) rather than threatening.

### Conclusion
Postwar Japanese ethics have navigated profound contradictions: pacifism vs. security, corporate loyalty vs. exploitation, technological progress vs. ecological harm. These tensions continue to shape Japan’s ethical landscape, offering lessons for global debates on peace, sustainability, and the human condition.

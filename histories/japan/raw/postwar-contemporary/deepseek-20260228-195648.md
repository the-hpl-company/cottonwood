# Japanese Ethical Thought, 1945–Present: From Postwar Ruin to Society 5.0

## 1. Article 9: The Renunciation of War as Ethical Commitment
**Text:** “Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes…land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.” (日本国憲法第9条, enacted 3 May 1947)

**Authorship Debate:** The initial draft was prepared by the Government Section of SCAP under General MacArthur (1946), with significant contributions from **Beate Sirota Gordon** (women’s rights articles) and **Milton Esman**. However, the ethical weight derives from its **domestic ratification** by the Imperial Diet and its embrace by the Japanese public, particularly war-weary citizens and progressive intellectuals.

**Imposed or Embraced?** While externally prompted, Article 9 was internalized through:
- **Unofficial constitutional theory** (非公式憲法理論) of **Maruyama Masao**, who argued it represented a revolutionary break from the emperor-centered *kokutai* (国体) and embodied popular sovereignty.
- The **Peace Preservation Law** replacement: The 1952 **Subversive Activities Prevention Act** (破壊活動防止法) framed pacifism as a civic duty.
- **Anpo protests** (1960, 1970): Mass movements defending Article 9 as a moral identity.

**Ongoing Revision Debate:**  
- **1991 Gulf War:** Japan’s “checkbook diplomacy” crisis sparked the **1992 International Peace Cooperation Act** (国際平和協力法), allowing non-combat SDF deployments.  
- **2015 Security Legislation:** Abe Shinzō’s reinterpretation allowing collective self-defense, challenged by scholars like **Karatani Kojin** as “constitutional betrayal.”  
- **2022 Kishida administration:** Commitment to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, testing Article 9’s limits.

## 2. Hiroshima and Nagasaki as Ethical Touchstones
**Hibakusha Testimony as Ethical Literature:**  
- **1952:** Publication of *Hiroshima* by John Hersey (Japanese edition) and **原爆の子** (*Children of the Atomic Bomb*) by **Ibuse Masuji** (1951) catalyzed national consciousness.  
- **1963:** **原爆詩集** (*Poems of the Atomic Bomb*) by **Kurihara Sadako** framed suffering as a universal ethical warning.  
- **1971:** Founding of **Nihon Hidankyō** (日本被団協, Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations), making *hibakusha* testimony central to disarmament diplomacy.

**Nuclear Ethics in State Policy:**  
- **1967 Three Non-Nuclear Principles** (非核三原則): Non-possession, non-production, non-introduction—later adopted as parliamentary resolution (1971).  
- **1996:** Japan led the **International Court of Justice advisory opinion** on nuclear weapons illegality.  
- **2016:** Obama’s Hiroshima visit reinforced Japan’s role as “moral conscience” despite relying on U.S. nuclear umbrella.

## 3. Economic Miracle Ethics: Corporate Loyalty and Its Costs
**Postwar Corporate Ethics Framework:**  
- **1955:** **Shūshin koyō** (終身雇用, lifetime employment) systematized at major *keiretsu*, creating a **moral economy of reciprocal obligation** (義理, *giri*).  
- **1962:** **Quality Control Circles** (品質管理サークル) pioneered at Nippon Steel—worker participation as ethical duty.  
- **Salaryman Ethic:** **Kigyō senshi** (企業戦士, corporate warrior) ideal celebrated in media like **漫画・サラリーマン金太郎** (1994).

**Ethical Suppressions and Crises:**  
- **1980s:** **Karōshi** (過労死, death from overwork) recognized as legal category; first court ruling (1988) against Dentsū.  
- **1991–92:** Bubble collapse revealed **tobashi** (飛ばし, hiding losses) and **sōkaiya** (総会屋, corporate extortion) as ethical failures of group loyalty.

## 4. Minamata Disease (1956–) and Environmental Ethics
**Catastrophe and Cover-up:**  
- **1956:** Official discovery in Minamata, Kumamoto; **Chisso Corporation** suppressed research linking mercury to disease.  
- **1969:** **Ui Jun**’s **公害原論** (*Theory of Industrial Pollution*) framed pollution as structural violence.  
- **1971:** **W. Eugene Smith**’s photo **Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath** (1972) globalized the ethical outrage.

**Legal and Ethical Shifts:**  
- **1973:** **Kumamoto District Court** found Chisso president criminally negligent.  
- **1994:** **Environmental Basic Act** (環境基本法) established **kankyō ken** (環境権, environmental right) as constitutional.  
- **2004:** **Supreme Court** upheld state liability, forcing national compensation—a landmark for **corporate social responsibility** (CSR) in Japan.

## 5. Lost Decades and Ethical Disillusionment
**Collapse of Collective Contract:**  
- **1997–98:** Financial crisis ended *shūshin koyō* for 40% of workforce; rise of **furītā** (フリーター, precarious labor).  
- **1998:** **Hikikomori** (引きこもり) coined by **Saitō Tamaki** as ethical critique of performance-based society.  
- **2005:** **Karoshi White Paper** linked 147 suicides to overwork.

**Demographic Ethics:**  
- **1989:** **1.57 Shock**—birth rate collapse prompting **Angel Plan** (1994) but failing to address **gender ethics** critiqued by **Ueno Chizuko**: “The Japanese family system is built on women’s unpaid labor.” (*The Modern Family in Japan*, 2009)

## 6. Fukushima (2011): Nuclear Trauma Revisited
**Ethical Failures:**  
- **2012:** **National Diet Investigation Commission** report called disaster “man-made” due to **sōteigai** (想定外, “unforeseen”) mindset and **regulatory capture**.  
- **2014:** **Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission** cited **ethical amnesia** of Hiroshima legacy.

**Post-Fukushima Ethics:**  
- **2012:** **Feed-in Tariff Act** promoting renewables as ethical imperative.  
- **2014:** **Nuclear Regulation Authority** established, but public trust remains low—only 10 reactors restarted by 2023.

## 7. AI and Robot Ethics: From Astro Boy to Society 5.0
**Cultural Foundations:**  
- **1952–68:** **Tezuka Osamu**’s **鉄腕アトム** (*Astro Boy*) established **robot as compassionate companion** (友, *tomo*).  
- **1986:** **MITI’s** (now METI) **Fifth Generation Computer Project** framed AI as public good.

**Contemporary Frameworks:**  
- **2016:** **Society 5.0** (超スマート社会) policy—AI should solve social problems (aging, disaster response) not just economic growth.  
- **2019:** **AI Strategy Guidelines** emphasize **human-centric AI** (人間中心のAI), contrasting with EU’s rights-based and China’s state-control models.  
- **2021:** **Fugaku** supercomputer used for COVID-19 simulation—public health as ethical priority.

**Governance Differences:**  
- **Japan:** **Amakudari** (天下り, bureaucrat-to-industry ties) shapes soft regulation.  
- **Key Scholar:** **Ishiguro Hiroshi** (roboticist) argues for **sonzai-kan** (存在感, “presence”) ethics over functional efficiency.

## 8. Key Scholars and Their Ethical Frameworks

**Maruyama Masao** (1914–1996):  
- **1946:** **「超国家主義の論理と心理」** (“Logic and Psychology of Ultranationalism”) diagnosed prewar ethical failure as *shutaisei* (主体性, subjectivity) deficit.  
- **1961:** **「日本の思想」** (*Japanese Thought*) argued Article 9 enabled democratic *kokumin* (国民, nation-people) ethics.

**Karatani Kojin** (b. 1941):  
- **2004:** **「世界共和国へ」** (*Transcritique*) re-read Article 9 as **ethical resistance to nation-state system**.

**Ueno Chizuko** (b. 1948):  
- **1990:** **「近代家族の成立と終焉」** (*The Modern Family: Its Rise and Fall*) critiqued **ie** (家) system as source of gender harm.  
- **2021:** **「ケアの社会学」** (*Sociology of Care*) advocates **care ethics** against productivityism.

**Oguma Eiji** (b. 1962):  
- **2002:** **「「民主」と「愛国」」** (*Democracy and Patriotism*) traced postwar ethical contradictions through grassroots movements.

## Conclusion: An Ethics of Fragile Balance
Postwar Japanese ethics navigates **irreconcilable tensions**: pacifism vs. security, growth vs. environment, loyalty vs. individuality. The **Heisei** (1989–2019) and **Reiwa** eras reveal a society grappling with what **Karatani** calls **「定常状態の倫理」** (“ethics of steady-state”)—no longer miracle-driven but seeking care-based frameworks. Yet **Article 9 revision pressures**, **Fukushima legacy**, and **AI governance challenges** test whether Japan’s ethical thought can sustain its humanistic traditions amid 21st-century crises.

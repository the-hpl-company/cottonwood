Here is a survey of Japanese ethical thought from 1945 to the present, addressing the issues you've specified:

**1. The Peace Constitution and Article 9**

The 1947 Constitution of Japan, particularly Article 9, is a cornerstone of postwar Japanese ethics. Article 9 states:

*"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.*

*In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."*

*Authorship*: The drafting process involved both Japanese and American actors. While the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), General Douglas MacArthur, initiated the process, the final wording was influenced by both American and Japanese perspectives. Beate Sirota Gordon, a young woman on MacArthur's staff, played a key role in drafting the sections on women's rights and gender equality. The specific wording of Article 9 is often attributed to MacArthur himself.

*Legitimacy*: The question of whether Article 9 was "imposed" is a subject of ongoing debate. While SCAP undeniably played a central role, Japanese politicians ratified the constitution. The constitution and Article 9 resonated with a public traumatized by war.

*Evolution*: Over time, Japan has interpreted Article 9 to allow for a "Self-Defense Force" (Jieitai, 自衛隊), a position constitutionally controversial but politically accepted. The debate over revising Article 9 remains a contentious issue, with proponents arguing for a more "normal" military posture and opponents emphasizing Japan's commitment to peace. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (in office 2006-2007, 2012-2020) sought constitutional revision to normalize the Self-Defense Forces. As of 2024, the debate continues.

**2. Hiroshima and Nagasaki as Ethical Touchstones**

The atomic bombings of Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945) are foundational to Japan's postwar ethical identity.

*Hibakusha*: The experiences of the *hibakusha* (被爆者, A-bomb survivors) became powerful ethical literature. Accounts like *Black Rain* (Kuroi Ame, 黒い雨, 1966) by Masuji Ibuse (井伏 鱒二, 1898-1993) vividly depict the horrors of the bombing and its aftermath. The hibakusha have become global advocates for nuclear disarmament, sharing their stories to prevent future tragedies.

*Nuclear Ethics*: As the only nation to have experienced nuclear attacks, Japan has a unique moral perspective on nuclear weapons. Japan's official policy is non-possession, non-production, and non-introduction of nuclear weapons (the "Three Non-Nuclear Principles"). However, Japan relies on the US nuclear umbrella for its security, creating an ethical tension.

**3. The Economic Miracle and its Ethical Dimensions**

From the 1950s to the 1980s, Japan experienced rapid economic growth, known as the "economic miracle." This was underpinned by a specific set of business practices and ethical assumptions:

*   *Lifetime Employment (shūshin koyō, 終身雇用)*: Provided workers with job security and fostered loyalty.
*   *Corporate Loyalty*: Employees were expected to prioritize the company's interests.
*   *Quality Circles (QC circles)*: Emphasized employee participation in improving production processes.

*The Salaryman Ethic*: The "salaryman" (sararīman, サラリーマン) became a symbol of this era, embodying dedication, hard work, and conformity. The salaryman ethic prioritized collective goals over individual needs.

*Ethical Suppression*: This corporate culture also suppressed dissent and individuality. Conformity and long working hours were expected.

*Karoshi (過労死)*: "Death from overwork" became a recognized social problem, highlighting the dark side of the economic miracle's ethics. It reflects a breakdown in the balance between work and personal life, and the pressures of corporate culture.

**4. Minamata Disease (1956-) as Ethical Catastrophe**

Minamata disease, caused by mercury poisoning from industrial wastewater in Minamata Bay, is a major environmental and ethical disaster.

*   *Corporate Cover-up*: Chisso Corporation, the company responsible, initially denied responsibility and delayed taking action.
*   *Government Complicity*: The government was slow to respond, prioritizing economic growth over public health.
*   *Community Suffering*: The disease caused severe neurological damage and birth defects, devastating the local community.
*   *W. Eugene Smith*: The photographs of W. Eugene Smith, particularly his image of Tomoko Uemura being bathed by her mother, brought global attention to the tragedy.

*Environmental Ethics*: Minamata raised profound questions about corporate responsibility, environmental protection, and the value of human life. It contributed to the rise of environmental activism in Japan and led to stricter environmental regulations.

**5. The Bubble, the Lost Decades, and Ethical Disillusionment**

The collapse of the Japanese asset bubble in the early 1990s ushered in a period of economic stagnation known as the "Lost Decades."

*   *Breaking of the Collective Contract*: The economic downturn undermined the traditional employment system and the implicit contract between companies and employees.
*   *Hikikomori (引きこもり)*: "Social withdrawal" became a recognized phenomenon, reflecting a sense of disillusionment and hopelessness among some young people.
*   *Declining Birth Rate*: Japan's declining birth rate is linked to economic insecurity and changing social values.
*   *Erosion of Trust*: Faith in institutions and the traditional social order declined.

**6. Fukushima (2011) and the Ethics of Technology and Risk**

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami, raised fundamental questions about the ethics of nuclear technology, risk management, and institutional trust.

*   *Nuclear Trauma*: The disaster reignited Japan's historical trauma related to nuclear weapons and radiation.
*   *Trust Deficit*: The government and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) were criticized for their handling of the crisis, leading to a further decline in public trust.
*   *Re-evaluation of Energy Policy*: The disaster prompted a re-evaluation of Japan's reliance on nuclear power and a push for renewable energy sources. However, as of 2024, nuclear reactors are being restarted due to energy security concerns.

**7. Contemporary Japanese Ethics and AI**

Japan is actively developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, with a focus on using AI to address social challenges.

*   *Fugaku*: Japan's Fugaku supercomputer is used for AI research and development.
*   *Robot Ethics*: Japan has a long tradition of positive portrayals of robots in popular culture, such as Astro Boy (Tetsuwan Atomu, 鉄腕アトム), which reflects a more optimistic view of AI than is sometimes found in the West.
*   *Society 5.0*: The Japanese government's "Society 5.0" initiative envisions a hyper-connected, AI-driven society that addresses challenges such as an aging population and declining workforce. This reflects a vision of technology as a tool for social good.
*   *AI Governance*: Japan's approach to AI governance emphasizes collaboration between government, industry, and academia. There is a focus on promoting innovation while also addressing ethical concerns.

**8. Key Scholars**

*   *Maruyama Masao (丸山 眞男, 1914-1996)*: A political theorist who explored the legacy of prewar ideology and the challenges of democratization in postwar Japan.
*   *Karatani Kojin (柄谷 行人, 1941-)*: A literary critic and philosopher who critiques capitalism and nationalism.
*   *Ueno Chizuko (上野 千鶴子, 1948-)*: A feminist sociologist who examines gender inequality and the patriarchal structures of Japanese society.
*   *Oguma Eiji (小熊 英二, 1962-)*: A historian who studies Japanese identity, nationalism, and social movements.

In sum, Japanese ethical thought since 1945 has been shaped by the experience of war, economic development, environmental disasters, and technological change. It is characterized by a tension between collective values and individual rights, tradition and modernity, and a deep concern with issues of peace, justice, and social responsibility.

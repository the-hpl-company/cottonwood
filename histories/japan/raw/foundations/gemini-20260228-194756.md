Okay, here is an account of the foundational ethical frameworks in Japan, from prehistory through the 6th century CE, drawing on primary sources and major scholarship:

**1. Shinto Ethics:**

Shinto, meaning "the way of the *kami*," is the indigenous religious tradition of Japan. It does not have a single founder or a codified scripture in the same way as Buddhism or Christianity. Instead, Shinto ethics are woven into myth, ritual, and daily life.

*   ***Kegare*** **(Impurity) and** ***Harae*** **(Purification):** A central concept in Shinto ethics is *kegare*, often translated as pollution, impurity, or defilement. *Kegare* is not necessarily moral evil, but rather a state of imbalance that disrupts the natural order and the relationship between humans and the *kami*. *Kegare* can arise from contact with death, disease, menstruation, or wrongdoing. *Harae* is the practice of purification, aimed at removing *kegare* and restoring harmony. Ritual cleansing with water, salt, or fire are common forms of *harae*. As scholar Helen Hardacre notes, "Purity is next to godliness" in Shinto, and maintaining purity is a constant ethical concern. (Hardacre, *Shinto and the State, 1868-1988*, p. 11).

*   ***Musubi*** **(Creative/Harmonizing Power):** *Musubi* refers to the generative and harmonizing power that connects all things. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the world and the importance of fostering positive relationships. *Musubi* is the force that brings things into being and maintains balance. Ethical action, in this context, involves aligning oneself with *musubi* and contributing to the flourishing of life.

*   **The** ***Kojiki*** **(712) and** ***Nihon Shoki*** **(720) as Ethical Texts:** These are the earliest extant written records of Japanese myths and history. While not explicitly ethical treatises, they provide a foundation for Shinto ethics by narrating the origins of the world, the *kami*, and the Japanese imperial line.

    *   **Creation Myths:** The *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki* describe the creation of Japan by the *kami* Izanagi and Izanami. Their union and subsequent creation of the islands of Japan and various *kami* establish a model of harmonious cooperation and the sacredness of the land. However, the myth also includes the tragic death of Izanami and Izanagi's descent to the underworld (*Yomi*), highlighting the ever-present threat of *kegare* and the need for purification.
    *   **Amaterasu and the Imperial Line:** The most important deity in Shinto is Amaterasu-ōmikami, the sun goddess. The *Kojiki* recounts how her grandson, Ninigi-no-Mikoto, was sent to earth to rule Japan, establishing the divine lineage of the imperial family. This myth provides a basis for the emperor's authority and the idea of Japan as a divinely ordained nation. However, it also contains episodes of conflict and deception, such as the story of Susano-o's disruptive behavior and Amaterasu's temporary withdrawal into a cave, which plunged the world into darkness. These narratives suggest that even the divine realm is not immune to disharmony and that ethical action is necessary to maintain order.

**2. The Concept of** ***Wa*** **(Harmony):**

*Wa*, meaning harmony, peace, or concord, is often presented as a central value in Japanese culture. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining social cohesion and avoiding conflict.

*   **Prince Shotoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution (604):** This document, attributed to Prince Shotoku, is one of the earliest examples of Japanese political and ethical thought. Its first article states: "Harmony is to be valued, and contentiousness avoided. For all men are inclined to partisanship, and few are discerning. Hence there are some who disobey their lords and fathers, or who clash with their neighbors. But when those above are harmonious and those below are conciliatory, there is concord in the discussion of all matters, and the accomplishment of every undertaking." (Article 1, Seventeen-Article Constitution).
    *   This emphasis on *wa* reflects a desire for social stability and cooperation in the face of political and social upheaval. However, as scholars like Mark Teeuwen argue, the pursuit of *wa* can also suppress dissent and reinforce existing power structures. Whose harmony is being prioritized? Who is silenced in the name of maintaining social order? (Teeuwen, *A History of Shinto*, p. 45).
    *   The Constitution also incorporates Buddhist and Confucian principles, such as reverence for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) and the importance of ethical leadership. This reflects an early attempt to synthesize different ethical systems.

**3. The Relationship Between** ***Kami*** **and Ethical Obligation:**

*   ***Kami*** **as Immanent Divinity:** *Kami* are divine spirits or forces that inhabit all things – natural objects like mountains, trees, and rivers, as well as ancestors, heroes, and abstract concepts. This belief in the immanence of divinity shapes ethical obligations in several ways:
    *   **Reverence for Nature:** The belief that *kami* reside in nature fosters a sense of respect and responsibility towards the environment. Actions that harm or pollute the natural world are seen as disrespectful to the *kami* and disruptive to the harmony of the universe.
    *   **Ancestor Veneration:** Ancestors are considered *kami* and are venerated through rituals and offerings. This reinforces family ties and emphasizes the importance of honoring one's heritage.
    *   **Ethical Conduct:** Ethical behavior is seen as a way of pleasing the *kami* and maintaining their favor. Conversely, unethical actions can bring about misfortune or divine retribution.

*   **Difference from Monotheistic Ethical Obligation:** Unlike monotheistic religions, where ethical obligations are often based on divine commands, Shinto ethics are more closely tied to the natural world and social relationships. There is no single, all-powerful god who dictates morality. Instead, ethical obligations arise from the desire to live in harmony with the *kami* and to maintain the well-being of the community. As John Breen and Mark Teeuwen argue, Shinto ethics are less about abstract principles and more about concrete practices and rituals that cultivate a sense of connection to the divine and the natural world. (Breen and Teeuwen, *Shinto: A Short History*, p. 15).

**4. The Arrival of Buddhism (6th Century):**

Buddhism arrived in Japan from Korea in the 6th century, bringing with it a complex system of philosophy, ethics, and ritual.

*   **Forms of Buddhism:** The forms of Buddhism that initially arrived in Japan were primarily Mahayana traditions from China and Korea, emphasizing the bodhisattva ideal of universal salvation and the importance of compassion. Key concepts included:
    *   **The Four Noble Truths:** Suffering exists, it has a cause, it can be overcome, and there is a path to liberation.
    *   **The Eightfold Path:** Right understanding, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.
    *   **Karma and Rebirth:** Actions have consequences that affect one's future lives.
*   **Synthesis of Buddhist and Shinto Ethics:** Early Japanese thinkers sought to integrate Buddhist ethics with existing Shinto beliefs. One common approach was to view the *kami* as local manifestations of Buddhist deities (a process called *shinbutsu-shūgō*, syncretism of *kami* and buddhas). This allowed people to venerate both the *kami* and the Buddha without necessarily seeing them as contradictory.
    *   Prince Shotoku, for example, promoted Buddhism as a way to enhance the moral character of the nation and to bring peace and prosperity. He saw Buddhism as complementary to Shinto, rather than as a replacement.
*   **The Soga-Mononobe Conflict:** The introduction of Buddhism was not without conflict. The Soga clan, who were early adopters of Buddhism, clashed with the Mononobe clan, who staunchly defended traditional Shinto beliefs. This conflict was not purely religious; it also involved political power struggles. The Soga clan's eventual victory paved the way for the widespread adoption of Buddhism in Japan, but it also marked a period of social and political upheaval.

**5. Ainu Ethical Traditions:**

The Ainu are the indigenous people of northern Japan (Hokkaido) and parts of Russia. Their ethical traditions are deeply intertwined with their relationship with the natural world and their belief in *kamuy*.

*   ***Kamuy*** **(Divine Beings):** *Kamuy* are divine beings that inhabit all things in the natural world, similar to the Shinto *kami*. Animals, plants, mountains, and rivers are all considered *kamuy*. Respect for *kamuy* is central to Ainu ethics.
*   **The** ***Iomante*** **Ceremony:** The *iomante* is a ritual in which a bear cub is raised for a period of time and then sacrificed. The ritual is seen as a way of sending the bear's spirit back to the realm of the *kamuy* with honor and gratitude. It is a complex and controversial practice, but it reflects the Ainu belief in the cyclical nature of life and the importance of maintaining a balanced relationship with the *kamuy*.
    *   As Donald Philippi explains, "The bear is regarded as a divine messenger… The bear is sent back to the mountain, its homeland, with gifts and honors, so that it may intercede with the gods on behalf of the Ainu people." (Philippi, *Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans*, p. 22).
*   **Suppression and Persistence:** During the Meiji period (1868-1912), the Japanese government implemented policies aimed at assimilating the Ainu into Japanese society. These policies included banning Ainu language, customs, and religious practices, including the *iomante*. While these policies have had a devastating impact on Ainu culture, Ainu people have continued to preserve their traditions and to advocate for their rights. Today, there is a growing movement to revitalize Ainu language and culture and to recognize the Ainu as an indigenous people with distinct rights and traditions.

**6. Key Scholars:**

*   **Helen Hardacre:** A leading scholar of Shinto, Hardacre has written extensively on the relationship between Shinto and the state, as well as on the role of women in Shinto.
*   **John Breen and Mark Teeuwen:** Breen and Teeuwen are historians of Shinto who have emphasized the importance of understanding Shinto as a dynamic and evolving tradition, rather than as a static set of beliefs.
*   **Donald Philippi:** A translator and scholar of Japanese and Ainu literature, Philippi has made important contributions to the understanding of Ainu culture and religion.

In summary, the foundational ethical frameworks of Japan were shaped by Shinto's emphasis on purity, harmony, and reverence for nature, as well as by the later introduction of Buddhist ethics. These traditions have been both complementary and conflicting, and they have been constantly reinterpreted and adapted over time. Furthermore, it's crucial to acknowledge the existence and suppression of Ainu ethical traditions, underscoring the importance of recognizing diverse perspectives within Japan's ethical landscape.

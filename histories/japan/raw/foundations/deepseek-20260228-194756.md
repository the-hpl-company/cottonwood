## **Foundational Ethical Frameworks of Japan: Pre-history to 6th Century CE**

### **1. Shinto Ethics: *Kegare*, *Harae*, *Musubi*, and the Mythic Framework**
The earliest ethical framework emerges from ritual practices and mythic narratives centered on life, vitality, and relational harmony, not abstract moral codes.

- ***Kegare* (穢れ) and *Harae* (祓え):** *Kegare* is not sin but a state of ritual impurity arising from contact with death, blood, disease, or moral transgression (e.g., betrayal, disorder). It is a contagious condition that disrupts communal and cosmic harmony. *Harae* is purification—the restoration of purity (*kiyome*) through water, salt, or ritual incantations (*norito*). The ethical imperative is to avoid *kegare* and perform *harae* to maintain collective wellbeing. As recorded in the *Englishiki* (927 CE) Book 8, the *Ōharae no Kotoba* (Great Purification Ritual) declares: "All sins and impurities... are to be purged and cleansed" (*subeku ayamachi tsumi kegare... harai kiyometamae*). This establishes a **relational, situational ethics** where harm is pollution, and care is purification.

- ***Musubi* (結び):** The creative, harmonizing power that binds all things. In the *Kojiki* (712 CE) and *Nihon Shoki* (720 CE), the primordial *kami* *Takamimusubi* (High Generative Force) and *Kamimusubi* (Divine Generative Force) initiate creation. *Musubi* implies that ethical action fosters generative, life-affirming connections. The myth of *Izanagi* and *Izanami* illustrates both creative *musubi* (giving birth to the land and *kami*) and the origin of *kegare* (Izanagi's pollution from witnessing Izanami's corpse in Yomi, the land of the dead).

- **Ethical Framework of the Creation Myths:** The *Kojiki*'s opening chapters (*Kamiyo no Maki*) present an ethics of **aesthetic order, fertility, and sincerity (*makoto*)**. The *kami* are not omnipotent moral legislators; they are fallible, passionate beings whose actions generate the world. Ethical failure appears as **disorder, deception, and disruption of natural cycles**. For example, the *kami* *Susanowo*'s violent acts—destroying rice fields, flaying a heavenly pony—are condemned not as "sins" but as violations of agricultural and ritual order, polluting his sister Amaterasu's realm and causing her to hide in a cave. Resolution comes through ritual purification, restitution, and the restoration of light and fertility. As Donald Philippi translates in *Kojiki* (1968), the gods declare Susanowo's offenses "unpardonable" (*awa-nagi*) and impose fines and ritual expulsions.

### **2. *Wa* (和): The Politics of Harmony and Its Suppressions**
*Wa* is not mere agreement but a **cosmic and social principle of integrative balance**, demanding the subordination of individual will to collective stability.

- **Prince Shōtoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution (604 CE):** Article 1 begins: "*Wa o motte tōtoshi to nasu*" (Harmony is to be valued). The text, written in Classical Chinese, synthesizes Confucian, Buddhist, and Legalist concepts to stabilize the nascent Japanese state (*Yamato*). Its ethical architecture:
  - **Hierarchical Complementarity:** Articles 3, 12 enjoin obedience to the sovereign's commands, as the earth supports heaven.
  - **Buddhist Compassion:** Article 2 urges reverence for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).
  - **Confucian Propriety:** Article 4 expects ministers to decorously govern the people.
  - **Meritocratic Ideal:** Article 7 urges wise judgment over factional loyalty.

- **What *Wa* Suppresses:** *Wa* as state ideology suppresses **open conflict, dissent, and individual assertion**. It legitimizes the Yamato court's hegemony over rival clans (*uji*) and indigenous communities. The "harmony" enforced is that of the ruling elite. Historian **John Breen**, in *Shinto in History* (2000), notes that *wa* often served to "obscure and contain violence" by demanding submission to centralized authority. The *Nihon Shoki* (720 CE) records numerous "rebellions" (e.g., the **Iwai Rebellion**, 527 CE) that were in fact resistance by local chieftains to Yamato expansion—dissent framed as disruption of *wa*.

### **3. *Kami* and Ethical Obligation: An Animistic Contract**
*Kami* (神) are not transcendent moral authorities but **immanent, numinous presences** in nature, ancestors, and extraordinary phenomena (waterfalls, rocks, trees). Ethical duty arises from **reciprocity and awe**.

- **Difference from Monotheistic Ethics:** Unlike a divine command theory, obligation to *kami* is **non-dualistic and situational**. One cares for a *kami*-inhabited forest not because of a universal rule but because the *kami*'s vitality (*mitama*) sustains the community. Transgression is not "sin against God" but **disruption of a specific relationship**, causing *kegare*. The *Norito* (ritual prayers) in the *Englishiki* show petitions for practical blessings (harvest, health) in return for ritual purity and offerings. As **Helen Hardacre** writes in *Shinto: A History* (2016), the ethics is one of "**maintaining correct relationships**" with *kami* through ritual, not adhering to a revealed moral law.

### **4. Arrival of Buddhism: Ethical Synthesis and Conflict**
Buddhism arrived via Korean kingdom of Baekje c. 538/552 CE, bringing **Mahāyāna sutras** (e.g., *Lotus Sutra*, *Sutra of Golden Light*) and **monastic precepts** (*Vinaya*).

- **Buddhism as Ethical System:** It introduced **universal compassion (*jihi*), karma (*innen*), and the prohibition against taking life (*fussesho*)**. The *Sutra of Golden Light* (*Konkōmyōkyō*, 金光明経) explicitly links Buddhist kingship with moral governance and protection of the Dharma.

- **Soga-Mononobe Conflict (587 CE):** A pivotal ethical-political crisis. The **Soga clan** advocated Buddhism as a transcendent ethical framework for centralized state power. The **Mononobe clan**, guardians of traditional *kami* rituals, argued Buddhism would offend native *kami*, causing calamity. The *Nihon Shoki* records Mononobe no Okoshi warning that worship of "foreign deities" (*adashikuni no kami*) would incur the wrath of "our country's *kami*" (*wa ga kuni no kami*). The Soga victory under Prince Shōtoku initiated **syncretic strategies**:
  - ***Honji suijaku* (本地垂迹):** Buddhist deities (*honji*) manifest as Japanese *kami* (*suijaku*), allowing parallel worship.
  - **Ethical Layering:** Shinto provided **ritual purity** for communal prosperity; Buddhism addressed **karmic destiny, moral intention, and salvation**. The *Nihon Shoki* (Suiko 12, 604) notes Shōtoku's edict to "revere the Three Treasures," embedding Buddhist ethics into state law while maintaining *kami* rituals for harvest and purification.

### **5. Ainu Ethical Traditions: *Kamuy* and *Iomante***
The Ainu, indigenous to Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kurils, possess a distinct ethical worldview.

- ***Kamuy* (カムイ):** Divine beings inhabiting all phenomena (animals, plants, tools). Ethics centers on **reciprocal gift-giving (*uyarap*) between humans and *kamuy***. A hunted bear is not "killed" but welcomed as a *kamuy* visiting the human world; its gifts of fur and meat are reciprocated with ritual send-off (*iyomante*).

- ***Iomante* (イオマンテ) "Sending-Back" Ceremony:** The ritual sacrifice of a bear (reared from cub) embodies a **cosmic ethics of gratitude and regeneration**. The *kamuy*'s spirit returns to the divine realm (*kamuy mosir*) enriched by human hospitality, promising to return with blessings. As **ann-Elise Lewallen** notes in *The Fabric of Indigeneity* (2016), this reflects an **ethics of sustainable reciprocity**, where taking life requires ceremonial care and restitution.

- **Suppression and Persistence:** The Ainu worldview was suppressed by **Wajin** (ethnic Japanese) colonization, notably the 1799-1870s assimilation policies and 1899 *Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act*, which outlawed *iyomante* and forced agriculture. Yet, Ainu ethics persist in **oral traditions** (*yukar* epics), revitalized craftwork (*attush* textiles), and the 2019 **Ainu Policy Promotion Act** recognizing Ainu as Indigenous people. Scholar **Mark Teeuwen**, in *A New History of Shinto* (2010), observes that State Shinto historically cast Ainu practices as "primitive" to justify Yamato supremacy, obscuring their sophisticated ecological ethics.

### **6. Key Scholars Cited**
- **Helen Hardacre**: *Shinto: A History* (2016) – analyzes *kami* ethics as relational maintenance.
- **John Breen**: Co-editor *Shinto in History* (2000) – critiques political uses of *wa*.
- **Mark Teeuwen**: *A New History of Shinto* (2010) – examines syncretism and marginalization of Ainu traditions.
- **Donald Philippi**: *Kojiki* (1968 translation) – primary source access to mythic ethics.

### **Synthesis: Foundational Ethical Architecture**
By the 6th century, Japan's ethical foundations were **plural and situational**:
- **Shinto**: Ethics of purity/pollution, generative harmony, and ritual reciprocity with *kami*.
- ***Wa* (State Ideology)**: Ethics of hierarchical harmony suppressing dissent.
- **Buddhism**: Ethics of intention, compassion, and karmic causality.
- **Ainu**: Ethics of interspecies reciprocity and ceremonial exchange with *kamuy*.

The tension between these frameworks—**communal purity vs. universal compassion, hierarchical harmony vs. reciprocal ecology**—would shape all subsequent Japanese ethical thought.

### Foundational Ethical Frameworks of Japan (Pre-history to 6th Century CE)

#### 1. **Shinto Ethics: Kegare, Harae, and Musubi in Early Japan**
Shinto ethics emerged from the animistic worldview of early Japan, centered on concepts of **kegare** (汚れ, impurity/pollution) and **harae** (祓い, purification). These concepts framed ethical life as a cyclical process of maintaining spiritual cleanliness and restoring harmony with the forces of nature. **Musubi** (産霊, creative/harmonizing power), a divine principle described in the *Kojiki* (古事記, 712) and *Nihon Shoki* (日本書紀, 720), reflects the generative and unifying force of the kami (神, divine spirits). 

The creation myths in the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki* emphasize ethical principles of balance and reciprocity. For example, the myth of Izanagi and Izanami illustrates the necessity of correct ritual action (e.g., Izanagi’s purification after fleeing Yomi, the land of the dead) to restore order. Helen Hardacre (*Shinto: A History*, 2017) highlights how Shinto ethics focused on communal harmony through ritual purification rather than abstract moral codes. The ethical framework here is situational, tied to maintaining harmony with kami and avoiding kegare.

#### 2. **Wa (和): Harmony as Central Ethical Principle**
**Wa** (和, harmony) became a foundational ethical principle, enshrined in Prince Shōtoku’s *Seventeen-Article Constitution* (十七条憲法, 604). Article 1 declares: "Wa should be valued" (和を以て貴しと為す). However, this harmony was hierarchical, reflecting Confucian influence. Mark Teeuwen (*Shinto in History*, 2000) argues that wa often suppressed dissent and marginalized voices, prioritizing societal cohesion over individual justice. This ethical framework reinforced the Emperor’s divine authority and the social hierarchy, limiting ethical individualism.

#### 3. **Kami and Ethical Obligation**
Shinto ethics differ starkly from monotheistic frameworks. Kami pervade all things—mountains, rivers, and even tools—creating a sense of ethical obligation to respect and honor these divine spirits. The *Engishiki* (延喜式, 927) codified rituals for appeasing kami, reflecting an ethic of reciprocity and gratitude. Donald Philippi (*Kojiki*, 1968) notes that ethical action in Shinto revolves around maintaining harmonious relationships with kami rather than adhering to universal moral laws. This animistic worldview fosters a deeply ecological ethic, emphasizing care for the natural world.

#### 4. **Arrival of Buddhism and Synthesis with Shinto**
Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century via Korea and China, introducing ethical concepts like *karuṇā* (compassion) and *ahimsa* (non-harm). The Soga-Mononobe conflict (587 CE) exemplifies the clash between Buddhist ethics and Shinto traditions. The Soga clan, embracing Buddhism, saw it as a universal ethical system transcending Shinto’s localism. The Mononobe, defending Shinto, viewed Buddhism as foreign and disruptive.

Early Japanese thinkers began synthesizing Buddhist ethics with Shinto frameworks. The notion of **honji suijaku** (本地垂迹, "original essence and manifest traces") emerged, interpreting kami as manifestations of Buddhist deities. John Breen (*Shinto in History*, 2000) argues that this synthesis allowed Buddhism to adapt to Japanese cultural norms while preserving Shinto’s ecological and communal ethics.

#### 5. **Ainu Ethical Traditions: Kamuy and Iomante**
The Ainu, Indigenous people of northern Japan, developed their own ethical system centered on **kamuy** (divine beings). The **iomante** ceremony, involving the ritual sending of a bear’s spirit back to the kamuy realm, exemplified reciprocity between humans and divine beings. Ainu ethics emphasized gratitude, respect for nature, and communal responsibility. Unfortunately, these traditions were suppressed during Japan’s colonization of Hokkaido in the 19th century. Despite this, Ainu ethical values persist, influencing modern environmental movements in Japan.

#### 6. **Key Scholars**
- **Helen Hardacre**: Analyzes Shinto ethics and ritual practices.
- **John Breen**: Explores Shinto-Buddhist synthesis and historical development.
- **Mark Teeuwen**: Critiques the ideological use of wa and harmony.
- **Donald Philippi**: Provides authoritative translations of Shinto texts.

### Conclusion
Japan’s foundational ethical frameworks—Shinto’s focus on harmony with kami, the hierarchical principle of wa, and the synthesis of Buddhist compassion—created a unique moral landscape. These traditions, shaped by internal tensions and external influences, continue to inform Japanese ethical thought today.

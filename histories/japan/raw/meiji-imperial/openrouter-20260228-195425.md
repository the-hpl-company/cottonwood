### **Japanese Ethical Thought from Meiji Restoration through WWII (1868-1945): A Violent Transformation**  

The Meiji Restoration (1868) marked Japan’s forced entry into modernity, triggering an ethical revolution that fused Confucian loyalty, Shinto mythology, and Western legal frameworks—culminating in imperial fascism and wartime atrocities. Below is a structured analysis of key ethical developments.  

---

### **1. The Meiji Ethical Revolution: The Imperial Rescript on Education (1890)**  
**Ethical Framework:** The *Kyōiku Chokugo* (教育勅語) encoded a hybrid ethics of *chūkun aikoku* (忠君愛国, loyalty to emperor and love of nation), blending:  
- **Confucian hierarchy** (loyalty/filial piety, *chūkō* 忠孝)  
- **Shinto mytho-politics** (emperor as *arahitogami* 現人神, manifest deity)  
- **Modern nationalism** (state-controlled morality)  

The Rescript explicitly rejected Western individualism, stating:  
> *"Should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne."*  

This framed ethical duty as self-sacrifice (*gyokusai* 玉砕, "shattered jewel") for the emperor.

### **2. *Bunmei Kaika* (文明開化) & Fukuzawa Yukichi’s Ethical Modernization**  
Fukuzawa Yukichi (福沢諭吉, 1835–1901) in *Gakumon no Susume* (学問のすゝめ, *An Encouragement of Learning*, 1872–76) advocated:  
- **Utilitarian ethics** (*jitsugaku* 実学, "practical learning")  
- **Equality** (*byōdō* 平等) via Western liberalism  
- **Rejection of blind loyalty** (*mushūgi* 無主儀)  

Yet, by the 1880s, Japan **rejected** Western democracy, adopting instead:  
- **German statism** (via Hermann Roesler’s Meiji Constitution drafting)  
- **Social Darwinism** (*shinkaron* 進化論) justifying imperialism  

Fukuzawa later endorsed *Datsu-A Ron* (脱亜論, *"Leaving Asia"*, 1885), arguing Japan must dominate Asia to "civilize" it—a precursor to imperial ethics.

### **3. The Meiji Constitution (1889): *Kokutai* as Ethical Category**  
The Constitution enshrined:  
- **Divine sovereignty** (*shinsei shuchō* 神聖主張, Article 1: "The Emperor is sacred and inviolable")  
- **Militarized ethics** (*bushidō* 武士道 reinterpreted as state ideology)  
- **Limited rights** (freedom "within limits not prejudicial to peace and order")  

Unlike Western constitutions, it **sacralized obedience**, making the emperor (*Tennō* 天皇) the source of morality.

### **4. The Kyoto School & Ethical Complicity with Militarism**  
**Nishida Kitarō** (西田幾多郎, 1870–1945) developed *zettai mu* (絶対無, "absolute nothingness"), arguing:  
- Reality is a **self-contradictory unity** (*zettai mujunteki jikodōitsu* 絶対矛盾的自己同一)  
- The emperor embodies *basho* (場所, "place")—the ethical ground of Japan  

Yet **Tanabe Hajime** (田辺元, 1885–1962) and **Nishitani Keiji** (西谷啓治, 1900–1990) justified war:  
- **"Overcoming Modernity"** (*Kindai no Chōkoku* 近代の超克, 1942 symposium) framed war as anti-Western spiritual purification  
- **"Ethics of Death"** (*shi no rinri* 死の倫理) demanded self-annihilation for the state  

Postwar, Tanabe recanted in *Zangedō toshite no Tetsugaku* (懺悔道としての哲学, *Philosophy as Metanoetics*, 1946), but the damage was done.

### **5. State Shinto & the Ethics of Empire**  
The **Meiji government merged Shinto and state** (*saisei itchi* 祭政一致), creating:  
- **Emperor worship** (*Tennōsei* 天皇制) via the 1890 *Daijōsai* (大嘗祭, imperial enthronement rite)  
- **Yasukuni Shrine** (靖国神社, 1869) deifying war dead as *eirei* (英霊, "heroic spirits")  
- **"Liberating Asia" rhetoric** (*Dai Tōa Kyōeiken* 大東亜共栄圏, 1940) masking conquest  

Scholar **Maruyama Masao** (丸山眞男, 1914–1996) later critiqued this as *"fascism from above"* (*ue kara no fashizumu* 上からのファシズム).  

---

### **6. Wartime Atrocities & Ethical Failure**  
Japan’s ethical collapse included:  
- **Nanjing Massacre** (1937, ~300k dead)  
- **Comfort women** (*ianfu* 慰安婦, sexual slavery)  
- **Unit 731** (biological warfare experiments)  

Postwar **reckoning was minimal**:  
- The Tokyo Trials (1946–48) punished leaders but ignored Hirohito  
- **Tanabe’s *metanoia* (repentance)** was abstract, not political  
- **Nishitani Keiji** never fully recanted  

Historian **John Dower** (*War Without Mercy*, 1986) shows how **racial dehumanization** (*kichiku Bei-Ei* 鬼畜米英, "demon Anglo-Americans") enabled atrocities.

### **Conclusion: The Ethical Catastrophe of Modern Japan**  
Japan’s modern ethics **began with emancipatory potential** (Fukuzawa’s liberalism) but **collapsed into fascist metaphysics** (Kyoto School’s wartime justifications). The failure to reconcile **Shinto myth, Confucian duty, and Western law** produced an **ethics of annihilation**—one still contested today in Yasukuni visits and textbook revisionism.  

**Key Sources:**  
- *Kyōiku Chokugo* (1890)  
- Fukuzawa Yukichi, *Gakumon no Susume* (1872–76)  
- Nishida Kitarō, *Zen no Kenkyū* (善の研究, *An Inquiry into the Good*, 1911)  
- Tanabe Hajime, *Zangedō toshite no Tetsugaku* (1946)  
- Maruyama Masao, *Nihon no Shisō* (日本の思想, *Japanese Thought*, 1961)  
- John Dower, *War Without Mercy* (1986)  

This period remains Japan’s greatest ethical trauma—an unresolved tension between **universal humanism** and **particularist nationalism**.

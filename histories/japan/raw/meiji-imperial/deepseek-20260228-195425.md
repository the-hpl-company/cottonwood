# Japanese Ethical Thought, 1868–1945: From Imperial Restoration to Apocalypse

## 1. The Meiji Ethical Revolution: *Kyōiku Chokugo* (教育勅語, 1890) as Foundational Document
The **Imperial Rescript on Education** (October 30, 1890) is not merely an educational policy but a constitutional ethical scripture. It encodes a **hierarchical communalism** where:
- **Confucian virtues** are re-centered on the imperial house: *chū* (忠, loyalty) to the Emperor replaces the daimyō-lord relationship; *kō* (孝, filial piety) extends to the state as family (*kazoku kokka*, 家族国家).
- **Shinto mythology** provides the ontological basis: The unbroken imperial line (*bansei ikkei*, 万世一系) descended from Amaterasu Ōmikami legitimizes the ethical order. The Rescript opens with the Emperor invoking "the spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors" who founded the empire "on a basis broad and everlasting."
- **Modernization imperatives** appear as "public good" and "common interests," but always subordinate to the "glory of the Imperial Throne."

The ethical framework is **organicist**: the nation is a body (*kokutai*, 国体) with the Emperor as head, requiring each subject to perform their ordained role. This is explicitly contrasted with Western individualism in the **Commentaries on the Imperial Rescript** (1891) by Inoue Tetsujirō, who condemned Christian ethics as incompatible with Japanese *kokutai*.

## 2. *Bunmei Kaika* (文明開化): Fukuzawa Yukichi and Selective Westernization
Fukuzawa Yukichi's **"An Encouragement of Learning"** (*Gakumon no Susume*, 1872–76) argues for **utilitarian ethics** grounded in **jitsugaku* (実学, practical studies). Key transformations:
- **Kept**: Confucian emphasis on learning, but redirected toward Western science and technology.
- **Rejected**: Blind loyalty to tradition; feudal status ethics. Fukuzawa famously wrote: "Heaven does not create one person above or below another."
- **Transformed**: *Dōtoku* (morality) is redefined as **independence** (*dokuritsu*, 独立) and **self-respect** (*jison*, 自尊). However, Fukuzawa's later **"On Leaving Asia"** (*Datsu-A Ron*, 1885) reveals the limits: Western ethics apply only to Japan as it joins the "civilized" West, while justifying imperialism toward "backward" Asia.

The **Meirokusha** (1873–75) intellectuals debated how to adopt Western *natural rights* while preserving Japanese social cohesion. Nakamura Masanao’s translation of *Self-Help* (1871) as *Saikoku Risshihen* promoted Victorian individualism, but with a Confucian moralizing tone.

## 3. The Meiji Constitution (1889): *Kokutai* as Constitutional Ethics
The **Constitution of the Empire of Japan** (February 11, 1889) encodes a **theocratic paternalism**:
- **Sovereignty** resides in the Emperor (*Tennō shuken*, 天皇主権), "sacred and inviolable" (Article 3), deriving from "the line of emperors unbroken for ages eternal" (Preamble).
- **Rights** are "granted" by the Emperor (Articles 19–29) as privileges, not inherent; always limited by "the law" and "public order."
- **Ethical difference from Western constitutionalism**: No social contract; no popular sovereignty. The **Prussian model** (especially Albert Mosse's influence) is fused with **Shinto mytho-history**. The **Commentaries on the Constitution** (1889) by Itō Hirobumi explicitly reject "European theories of natural rights" as destructive to Japan's *kokutai*.

*Kokutai* becomes the supreme ethical category: an indivisible body politic whose health requires absolute loyalty. This is elaborated in the **Kokutai no Hongi** (国体の本義, 1937), which states: "The way of the subject is to be loyal to the Emperor... without regard for self."

## 4. The Kyoto School: Nishida Kitarō and Philosophical Complicity
**Nishida Kitarō** (1870–1945) developed Japan's first original philosophical system:
- **Logic of place** (*basho*, 場所): Reality is a "place of absolute nothingness" (*zettai mu no basho*, 絶対無の場所) where contradictions are overcome.
- **Ethical implications**: The self realizes itself by **self-negation** in the larger whole (the historical world). This becomes dangerously politicized: The **"overcoming modernity"** symposium (1942) featured Kyoto School philosophers arguing Japan's war was a **world-historical mission** to overcome Western modernity.

**Tanabe Hajime** (1885–1962) developed the **logic of species** (*shu no ronri*, 種の論理), where the nation (*species*) mediates between the individual and humanity. By 1943, he argued Japan must lead Asia through "**the death-and-resurrection of the nation**" – providing philosophical justification for the Greater East Asia War.

**Nishitani Keiji** (1900–1990) in **"The Standpoint of Zen"** (1943) described the war as a "**religious war**" to empty Western ego-centrism. The Kyoto School's sophistication lies in how it transformed Zen *mu* (無, nothingness) and Hegelian dialectics into a philosophy of **Japanese world-historical subjectivity**.

## 5. State Shintō and Imperial Ethics
**State Shintō** (*Kokka Shintō*, 国家神道) was constructed through:
- The **Shinbutsu Bunri** (神仏分離, 1868) edicts separating Shintō from Buddhism.
- The **Daikyōin** (大教院) system (1870s) making Shintō priests state officials.
- The **Emperor's "Declaration of Divinity"** (1946) was forced; until then, the **1940 National Polity Directive** stated: "The Emperor is a living god (*akitsumi kami*, 現御神)."

**Yasukuni Shrine** (1869) ethics: The **Yūshūkan** museum (1882) narrative transforms the war dead into *kami* whose souls "protect the nation." The **1939 Religious Organizations Law** made Yasukuni the apex of a national cult of sacrifice where dying for the Emperor became the highest ethical act.

**"Liberating Asia" ethics**: The **Greater East Asia Declaration** (1943) used Pan-Asian rhetoric ("**Hakkō Ichiu**," 八紘一宇, the whole world under one roof) but practiced **racial hierarchy** documented in the **"Treatment of Allied Prisoners of War"** (1942) orders that placed Western POWs below Japanese but above other Asians.

## 6. Wartime Atrocities and Ethical Failure
**Systematic ethical collapse** occurred through:
- **The Nanjing Massacre** (1937–38): Documented in the **Matsui Iwane diary** showing deliberate terror tactics. The **"Kill All, Loot All, Burn All"** (*sankō sakusen*, 三光作戦) policy in North China.
- **Comfort women system**: The **Yoshimi Yoshiaki archives** reveal the 1938 **"Regulations for Military Comfort Stations"** – state-organized sexual slavery rationalized as preventing rape and disease.
- **Unit 731**: Human experimentation under the **"Prevention of Epidemic and Water Purification Department"** euphemism, approved at the highest levels (Emperor Hirohito's 1940 directive).
- **POW treatment**: Violation of the **1929 Geneva Convention** (which Japan signed but never ratified) documented in the **International Military Tribunal for the Far East** (1946–48) transcripts.

**Tanabe Hajime's "Philosophy as Metanoetics"** (*Zangedō toshite no tetsugaku*, 1946) attempts reckoning:
- **Metanoesis** (*zange*, 懺悔) as "**absolute critique**" of reason after Japan's defeat.
- **Inadequacy**: Tanabe focuses on **philosophical failure**, not concrete responsibility. He never names specific atrocities or comfort women. It remains a **Buddhist-inspired self-critique** rather than political accountability.

## 7. Scholarly Reckoning
- **Maruyama Masao** in **"Thought and Behaviour in Modern Japanese Politics"** (1956) identifies the **"system of irresponsibility"** – ethical diffusion through the hierarchy where "everyone was responsible, so no one was responsible."
- **John Dower's "War Without Mercy"** (1986) documents the **racial ethical dualism**: Japanese saw themselves as spiritually pure (*Yamato damashii*, 大和魂) versus Western "materialism," while Americans saw Japanese as "vermin."
- **Andrew Gordon's "A Modern History of Japan"** (2003) shows how **"ethical nationalism"** was manufactured through schools, media, and the **Tonarigumi** (neighborhood associations) surveillance system.

## Conclusion: The Ethical Catastrophe
The period 1868–1945 represents the **total instrumentalization of ethics** for state power. Traditional virtues (*jin*, 仁, benevolence; *jihi*, 慈悲, compassion) were subordinated to *chū* (loyalty). Even Buddhism was co-opted: The **"Imperial Way Buddhism"** (*Kōdō Bukkyō*, 皇道仏教) movement (1930s) preached that killing for the Emperor was **non-killing** in the absolute sense (a distortion of Zen *soku* logic).

The ethical transformation was **violent** precisely because it was **comprehensive**: It rewrote Shinto myth as political fact, Confucian relations as imperial subjecthood, and Buddhist emptiness as historical destiny. The failure was not absence of ethics, but the **perfection of a nationalistic ethical system** that could justify anything in the name of *kokutai*.

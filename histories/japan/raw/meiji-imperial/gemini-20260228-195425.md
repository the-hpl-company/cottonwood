Here is an intellectual history of Japanese ethics from the Meiji Restoration through World War II (1868-1945), a period of immense transformation and ethical complexity.

**1. The Meiji Ethical Revolution and the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890)**

The Meiji Restoration (1868) marked Japan's rapid modernization and its entry onto the world stage. This era witnessed a deliberate construction of a new national identity, one that drew on selective interpretations of tradition while embracing Western advancements. The *Imperial Rescript on Education* (教育勅語, *Kyōiku Chokugo*) of 1890 became the cornerstone of this ethical project.

The *Rescript* was issued by Emperor Meiji and distributed to every school in the nation, to be recited at ceremonies. It outlined the moral virtues expected of Japanese citizens: filial piety, loyalty to the Emperor, marital fidelity, fraternal love, pursuit of learning, development of intellect, safeguarding morality, offering oneself to the State in times of emergency, and upholding the Constitution and laws.

The ethical framework of the *Rescript* can be understood as a fusion of:

*   **Confucianism:** Emphasizing filial piety (*kō*, 孝) and loyalty (*chū*, 忠) as the foundations of social order. The *Analects* (論語, *Rongo*) had long been a central text in Japanese education, and the *Rescript* reinforced these values within the context of the modern state.
*   **State Shinto:** Linking the Emperor to a divine lineage and positioning him as the embodiment of the nation's spirit (*kokutai*, 国体). This drew upon the *Kojiki* (古事記, 712) and *Nihon Shoki* (日本書紀, 720), which were reinterpreted to emphasize the Emperor's unbroken line and sacred authority.
*   **Modernization Imperatives:** Promoting the pursuit of learning and the development of intellect to strengthen the nation in the face of Western powers. This was framed as a patriotic duty, essential for Japan's survival and prosperity.

The *Rescript* established a powerful ethical framework that prioritized national unity and obedience to the Emperor. It became a tool for instilling a sense of shared identity and purpose, but also for suppressing dissent and enforcing conformity.

**2. *Bunmei Kaika* (Civilization and Enlightenment) and Fukuzawa Yukichi**

The *bunmei kaika* (文明開化) movement, which began in the early Meiji period, involved the selective adoption of Western ideas and institutions. Fukuzawa Yukichi (福澤 諭吉, 1835-1901) was one of its leading proponents. In his influential work *An Encouragement of Learning* (学問のすすめ, *Gakumon no Susume*, 1872-1876), Fukuzawa argued that individual independence and rational inquiry were essential for national progress.

Fukuzawa advocated for:

*   **Individualism:** Challenging traditional Confucian hierarchies and promoting the idea of individual rights and responsibilities. He argued that people should be valued for their abilities and contributions, not their social status.
*   **Practical Learning:** Emphasizing the importance of acquiring knowledge and skills that could be applied to solve real-world problems. He criticized the traditional Confucian focus on classical learning as impractical and irrelevant to modern life.
*   **National Independence:** Promoting the idea of a strong and independent Japan that could compete with Western powers. He believed that modernization was essential for preserving Japan's sovereignty.

While Fukuzawa embraced Western ideas, he also retained a strong sense of Japanese identity. He argued that Japan should adopt what was useful from the West while preserving its own unique culture and traditions. However, his emphasis on national strength and independence also laid the groundwork for future expansionism.

**3. The Meiji Constitution (1889) and *Kokutai***

The Meiji Constitution (大日本帝国憲法, *Dai Nippon Teikoku Kenpō*) of 1889 was modeled after the Prussian constitution and established a constitutional monarchy. However, it differed significantly from Western constitutional ethics in several key respects.

*   **Emperor's Sovereignty:** The Constitution declared that the Emperor was "sacred and inviolable" and held supreme authority. He was the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
*   **Limited Rights:** While the Constitution guaranteed certain rights and freedoms to citizens, these were subject to limitations imposed by law. The government had broad powers to restrict freedom of speech, assembly, and association in the name of national security.
*   ***Kokutai* (National Polity/Essence):** The concept of *kokutai* became central to Meiji-era ideology. It referred to the unique spiritual and cultural essence of Japan, embodied in the Emperor and the Japanese people. *Kokutai* was often invoked to justify policies that prioritized national unity and obedience to the state. It was deeply intertwined with State Shinto, reinforcing the idea of Japan as a divinely ordained nation with a special destiny.

The Meiji Constitution established a system in which the Emperor held ultimate authority, and individual rights were subordinate to the needs of the state. This framework provided the legal and ideological basis for Japan's subsequent expansionist policies.

**4. Nishida Kitaro and the Kyoto School**

Nishida Kitaro (西田 幾多郎, 1870-1945) was Japan's most influential philosopher of the 20th century and founder of the Kyoto School. His philosophy sought to synthesize Western thought with Eastern, particularly Zen Buddhist, insights. Key concepts include:

*   **The Logic of Place (Basho):** Nishida argued that reality is not a fixed substance but a dynamic field of relations. He used the concept of *basho* (場所, "place") to describe this field, which he saw as both the ground of being and the source of all differentiation.
*   **Absolute Nothingness (Zettai Mu):** Nishida drew on Zen Buddhism to develop the concept of *zettai mu* (絶対無, "absolute nothingness"). This is not simply the absence of being, but rather the dynamic and creative source from which all things arise.
*   **Action as Seeing:** Nishida emphasized the importance of action in understanding reality. He argued that we come to know the world not through passive observation but through active engagement with it.

The ethical implications of Nishida's philosophy are complex and contested. Some scholars argue that his emphasis on the dynamic and interconnected nature of reality could provide a basis for ethical responsibility and social justice. Others criticize his philosophy for its potential to be used to justify nationalism and militarism.

Tragically, some members of the Kyoto School, including Tanabe Hajime (田辺 元, 1885-1962) and Nishitani Keiji (西谷 啓治, 1900-1990), became entangled with wartime ideology. They developed philosophical justifications for Japan's expansionist policies, arguing that Japan had a unique mission to lead Asia and create a new world order. This highlights the dangers of abstract philosophical ideas being used to rationalize political violence.

**5. State Shinto and the Ethics of Empire**

State Shinto (国家神道, *Kokka Shintō*) was a system of state-sponsored religious practices that emerged during the Meiji period. It promoted the idea of the Emperor as a divine figure and emphasized the importance of ancestor worship and national loyalty.

*   **Emperor as Divine:** The Meiji government promoted the idea that the Emperor was a direct descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu (天照大神), as recounted in the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki*. This reinforced his authority and made him the focus of national devotion.
*   **Yasukuni Shrine:** The Yasukuni Shrine (靖国神社) was established in 1869 to commemorate those who had died in service of the Emperor. It became a symbol of national sacrifice and a focal point for wartime propaganda. Controversially, it includes the names of convicted war criminals, blurring the lines between patriotism and aggression.
*   **Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere:** The concept of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" (大東亜共栄圏, *Dai Tōa Kyōeiken*) was used to justify Japan's expansionist policies in Asia. It presented Japan as the leader of a unified Asia, liberating the region from Western colonialism and creating a new economic and political order. This was, in reality, a mask for Japanese imperialism, involving the exploitation and subjugation of other Asian countries.

State Shinto played a crucial role in mobilizing the Japanese population for war. It instilled a sense of national purpose and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for the Emperor and the nation.

**6. Wartime Atrocities and Ethical Failure**

Japan's wartime conduct was marked by numerous atrocities, including:

*   **The Nanjing Massacre (1937):** The Rape of Nanking (南京事件, *Nankin Jiken*) involved the mass murder of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war by Japanese troops. Estimates of the death toll range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.
*   **Comfort Women:** The forced sexual enslavement of women from Korea, China, the Philippines, and other countries by the Japanese military.
*   **Unit 731:** A secret biological and chemical warfare research unit that conducted experiments on human subjects, including prisoners of war and civilians.
*   **POW Treatment:** Japanese treatment of prisoners of war was notoriously brutal, with high rates of death and abuse.

These atrocities represent a profound ethical failure. They raise fundamental questions about the nature of wartime morality, the responsibility of individuals and institutions, and the legacy of historical trauma.

Tanabe Hajime, reflecting on his own complicity with wartime ideology, developed a "Philosophy of Metanoetics" (懺悔道としての哲学, *Zange Michi toshite no Tetsugaku*, 1946). *Metanoia* (悔い改め) is a Greek term for repentance and transformation. Tanabe argued that philosophy should be a process of self-reflection and repentance, aimed at overcoming one's own egoism and complicity in evil. While Tanabe's work is a significant attempt to grapple with the ethical failures of the wartime period, some critics argue that it does not go far enough in acknowledging the systemic nature of the atrocities and the need for collective responsibility.

**7. Key Scholars**

*   **Maruyama Masao (丸山 眞男, 1914-1996):** *Thought and Behaviour in Modern Japanese Politics* (1963) examines the structures of thought that enabled Japanese militarism. He analyzed the patterns of "thought and behavior" (思想と行動, *shisō to kōdō*) that led to the rise of authoritarianism and the suppression of individual freedom.
*   **John Dower:** *War Without Mercy: Race & Power in the Pacific War* (1986) explores the racial stereotypes and dehumanization that fueled the Pacific War.
*   **Andrew Gordon:** *A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present* (2019) provides a comprehensive overview of modern Japanese history, including the ethical dimensions of the Meiji Restoration, the rise of militarism, and the postwar period.

The period from the Meiji Restoration to the end of World War II was a time of profound ethical transformation in Japan. The nation underwent rapid modernization, embraced Western ideas, and constructed a new national identity centered on the Emperor and the *kokutai*. However, this process also led to the rise of militarism, expansionism, and ultimately, devastating wartime atrocities. The legacy of this period continues to shape Japanese society and its relationship with the world. Ethical reflection on this era is crucial for understanding Japan's past and building a more just and peaceful future.

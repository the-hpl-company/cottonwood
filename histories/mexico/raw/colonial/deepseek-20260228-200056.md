# The Colonial Period as Ethical Catastrophe and Response: Mexico, 1519–1821

## 1. **The Valladolid Debate (1550–1551): The First Formal Ethics of Conquest**
**The Contenders:**  
- **Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda**, *Democrates Alter* (1545), argued from Aristotelian natural philosophy: Indigenous peoples were *homunculi* (natural slaves), lacking *ratio* (reason) and *dominium* (self-governance), thus conquest was a “just war” to civilize them.  
- **Bartolomé de las Casas**, *Apologética Historia Sumaria* (1550), countered: Indigenous civilizations possessed *policía* (civil order), *ratio*, and natural rights under natural law. Conquest was tyranny.

**Who won? Did it matter?**  
No formal verdict was issued, but Las Casas’s arguments halted the publication of Sepúlveda’s treatise and influenced the **New Laws of 1542** (though often ignored in practice). The debate’s legacy is the **institutionalization of ethical doubt** within the colonial project itself—a crack in the edifice. As Enrique Dussel notes in *Philosophy of Liberation*, this was the first “world-scale” ethical debate about human dignity across civilizations (*1492: El encubrimiento del Otro*, 1992).

## 2. **Bartolomé de las Casas: From Encomendero to Defender**
**Evolution:**  
Arrived 1502, received an encomienda in Cuba. His conversion began around 1514 upon hearing Ecclesiasticus 34:18–22: “The bread of the needy is their life; he who withholds it is a murderer.” Ordained priest (1512), first in the Americas.

***Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias* (1552): Ethical Testimony**  
- **Specific Atrocities:** Describes Spaniards in Hispaniola “testing sharpness of swords on Indians,” in Nicaragua burning alive, in Mexico enslaving through *repartimiento*.  
- **Ethical Framework:** Uses Thomistic natural law—all humans possess *imago Dei*—and Augustinian just-war theory: no war can be just if its cause is greed (*avaricia*). He frames conquest as *pecado social* (social sin), a structural evil.  
- **Radical Proposal:** In *De thesauris* (1563), he argues all Spanish wealth from the Indies is stolen property requiring restitution.

## 3. **Franciscan Missions: Ethics of Conversion and Erasure**
**The Twelve Apostles of Mexico (1524):**  
Led by Martín de Valencia, these Franciscans saw Mesoamerica as the “New World” for a purified Christianity. Their mission: save souls while protecting Indians from encomenderos.

**Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco (1536):**  
Founded by Bernardino de Sahagún and Juan de Zumárraga. Trained Nahua nobles in Latin, rhetoric, and theology. Sahagún’s *Florentine Codex* (1577) preserved Nahua knowledge but served evangelization—an ethical paradox: preservation as tool for eradication.

**Motolinía vs. Las Casas:**  
- **Toribio de Benavente (Motolinía)**, *Historia de los indios de la Nueva España* (1541), defended mass baptism and saw suffering as purgative for idolatry. Accused Las Casas of exaggeration.  
- **Las Casas** condemned rapid baptism as coercion and criticized Motolinía’s complicity with colonial power.

**The Destruction of Ethical Systems:**  
Franciscans like Diego de Landa burned Maya codices (1562) at Maní, destroying ethical and historical texts like the *Popol Vuh* (though it survived in Highland Guatemala). The *Coloquios y doctrina cristiana* (1564) records Nahua priests lamenting: “You have taken from us our way of life.”

## 4. **Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Feminist Ethics in the Convent**
**“Hombres necios” (1689):**  
From *Primero sueño*, this satire indicts the double standard: “You foolish men who accuse / women without reason, / blind to the cause / of the very guilt you create.”

***Respuesta a Sor Filotea* (1691): Ethical Manifesto**  
Responding to Bishop Manuel Fernández de Santa Cruz (pseudonym Sor Filotea), who silenced her, Sor Juana defends women’s right to education using patristic sources (St. Jerome, St. Augustine) and natural reason: “I study because I must.”  
- **Ethical Core:** Intellectual pursuit as moral duty, critique of patriarchal authority masking as spiritual guidance.  
- **Outcome:** Forced to sell her library, died nursing during plague (1695). Her work embodies what Octavio Paz called “the exception that condemns the rule” (*Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz o las trampas de la fe*, 1982).

## 5. **Virgin of Guadalupe (1531): Ethical Synthesis and Erasure**
**Nican Mopohua* (1649):** The Nahuatl account by Antonio Valeriano describes apparitions to Juan Diego at Tepeyac, site of Tonantzin (Nahua mother goddess).  
- **Synthesis:** Guadalupe speaks Nahuatl, has mestizo features, appears to an indigenous man. She becomes symbol of *mestizaje* and protection.  
- **Preservation:** Indigenous devotion to Tonantzin transferred to Guadalupe, allowing covert continuity of cosmic feminine principle (*teotl*).  
- **Erasure:** Syncretism served colonial evangelization; the Church co-opted indigenous spirituality to ease conquest. As Dussel argues, it was a “colonization of the sacred.”  
- **Ethical Framework:** Guadalupe later becomes emblem of liberation (Hidalgo’s 1810 revolt, César Chávez), representing the **ethics of the marginalized** who reclaim the symbol.

## 6. **Mestizaje as Ethical Concept: Casta System and Blood Quantum**
**Casta Paintings (18th century):** Visual taxonomy of racial mixtures—*español*, *indio*, *negro*, and their derivatives (*mestizo*, *castizo*, *mulato*, etc.).  
- **Ethical Implications:** Society organized by *limpieza de sangre* (purity of blood), a hierarchy of human worth. The system institutionalized *daño* (harm) through stigma and legal disability.  
- **Mestizaje as Ambivalent:** For colonial elite, it signified degeneration; for later nationalists (José Vasconcelos, *La raza cósmica*, 1925), it was utopian fusion. In reality, it masked ongoing violence against indigenous and Afro-Mexican peoples.  
- **Gruzinski’s Analysis:** In *The Mestizo Mind* (2002), he shows mestizaje was less a fusion than a “colonization of the imagination,” where indigenous categories were subsumed.

## 7. **Key Scholars’ Interpretations**
- **Enrique Dussel:** Coloniality as “underside of modernity”; Valladolid was first “intercultural dialogue” but one-sided. Las Casas initiated “ethics of liberation” (*Ética de la liberación*, 1998).  
- **Octavio Paz:** In *El laberinto de la soledad* (1950), colonialism created the “Mexican mask”—a split identity born of violence and shame.  
- **Serge Gruzinski:** *La colonización de lo imaginario* (1988) details how Spanish symbols replaced but never fully erased indigenous thought.  
- **James Lockhart:** *The Nahuas After the Conquest* (1992) shows indigenous agency within colonial structures, adapting alphabetic writing to preserve memory.

## **Conclusion: The Colonial Ethical Catastrophe**
The colonial period was an ethical catastrophe founded on **structural harm**: mass death (≈90% population decline), cultural erasure, and the imposition of a racial caste system. Yet it generated **ethical responses** that became foundational for Mexican thought:
1. **Las Casas** established the principle of *defense of the Other*.
2. **Sor Juana** critiqued patriarchal authority from within.
3. **Guadalupe** became a symbol of resilient synthesis.
4. **Mestizaje** remains an unresolved ethical paradox—both violence and possibility.

The colonial ethical legacy is, as Dussel frames it, a **dialectic between the violence of conquest and the voices that denounced it**—a tension that would erupt in 1810 and shape all subsequent Mexican ethical thought.

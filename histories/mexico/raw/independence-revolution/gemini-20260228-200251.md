**Mexican Ethical Thought: Independence through Revolution (1810-1920)**

The period from Mexican Independence through the Revolution (1810-1920) was a crucible of ethical questioning, violent conflict, and radical reimagining of the nation's moral foundations.

**1. The Grito de Dolores and Early Independence (1810-1821)**

*   **The Grito de Dolores (September 16, 1810):** Father Miguel Hidalgo's call to arms in Dolores marked the beginning of the Independence War. While its immediate goals were political—overthrowing Spanish rule—it also contained ethical dimensions. Hidalgo appealed to the injustices suffered by indigenous and mestizo populations, mobilizing them against the peninsulares (Spanish-born elites).
*   **José María Morelos and *Sentimientos de la Nación* (1813):** Morelos, who assumed leadership after Hidalgo's execution, articulated a clearer ethical framework in his *Sentimientos de la Nación* ("Sentiments of the Nation"). This document, presented to the Congress of Anáhuac, outlined key principles:

    *   **Sovereignty of the People:** "That sovereignty resides originally in the people and is deposited in the Supreme National American Congress..." (Article 5). This challenged the divine right of kings and asserted popular self-determination.
    *   **Abolition of Slavery:** "That slavery be proscribed forever, as well as the distinction of castes, all remaining equal, and only vice and virtue distinguishing one American from another" (Article 15). This was a radical ethical stance for its time, condemning the inhumane practice of slavery and advocating for equality before the law.
    *   **Abolition of Caste:** The explicit rejection of the *casta* system, a hierarchical social order based on racial ancestry, aimed to dismantle a system of institutionalized discrimination that perpetuated inequality.

    Morelos's vision sought to create a society founded on principles of equality, justice, and popular sovereignty, a stark contrast to the colonial order.

**2. The Reform War and Benito Juárez (1857-1872)**

*   **The Reform War (1857-1860):** This civil war pitted liberals against conservatives, with profound implications for Mexican ethical thought. At its heart was the question of the role of the Catholic Church in Mexican society and politics.
*   **Benito Juárez and the *Leyes de Reforma*:** Juárez, an indigenous Zapotec lawyer who rose to become president, championed the liberal cause. The *Leyes de Reforma* ("Reform Laws") were a series of decrees that:

    *   **Separated Church and State:** Nationalized Church property, suppressed religious orders, and established civil marriage and registration of births and deaths.
    *   **Guaranteed Religious Freedom:** Limited the power and influence of the Catholic Church, promoting a secular state.

    Juárez's commitment to secularism, individual liberties, and the rule of law was deeply rooted in his belief in equality and social progress. As an indigenous person who overcame tremendous adversity to lead the nation, his biography itself became an ethical statement about the possibilities of social mobility and the potential of marginalized populations.

**3. Positivism and the Porfiriato (1876-1911)**

*   **Porfirio Díaz and the *Científicos*:** The long rule of Porfirio Díaz was characterized by a philosophy of positivism, embraced by a group of advisors known as the *Científicos*. Inspired by Auguste Comte, positivism emphasized scientific knowledge, order, and progress as the foundations of a modern society.
*   **"Order and Progress":** This became the motto of the Díaz regime. However, in practice, positivist ethics were used to justify:

    *   **Authoritarianism:** Political repression and the suppression of dissent were seen as necessary to maintain order and facilitate economic development.
    *   **Economic Exploitation:** Indigenous communities were dispossessed of their lands to make way for large haciendas and foreign investment. Laborers were subjected to harsh working conditions.
    *   **Social Inequality:** The *Científicos* believed in a natural social hierarchy, justifying the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small elite.

    Enrique Krauze, in *Mexico: Biography of Power*, analyzes how Díaz's regime, while modernizing the country in some respects, deepened social divisions and created the conditions for revolution.

**4. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920)**

*   **Ethical Chaos:** The Revolution was a period of profound upheaval, marked by competing ideologies, shifting alliances, and widespread violence. There was no single ethical framework that united the revolutionaries.
*   **Francisco Madero and Liberal Democracy:** Madero's initial call for revolution in the *Plan de San Luis* (1910) emphasized political reform and respect for democratic principles. However, his commitment to gradual change and his failure to address land reform alienated many.
*   **Emiliano Zapata and the *Plan de Ayala* (1911):** Zapata, leading the peasant rebellion in Morelos, articulated a radical agrarian ethic in the *Plan de Ayala*. Its core principles were:

    *   **Land and Liberty (*Tierra y Libertad*):** This slogan captured the Zapatistas' demand for the return of communal lands that had been seized by haciendas.
    *   **Restitution of Ejidos:** The *Plan* called for the restoration of *ejidos*, communal landholdings, to indigenous villages.
    *   **Revolutionary Justice:** It denounced Madero as a traitor and called for his overthrow, reflecting a willingness to use violence to achieve social justice.

    John Womack's *Zapata and the Mexican Revolution* emphasizes the moral force of Zapata's commitment to defending the land rights of his people.
*   **Pancho Villa and Popular Violence:** Villa, leading the *División del Norte*, embodied a different kind of revolutionary ethic. His focus was on:

    *   **Social Justice:** Villa sought to redistribute wealth and power to the poor.
    *   **Punishment of the Rich:** He often resorted to violence and confiscation to punish those who had exploited the common people.
    *   **Revolutionary Pragmatism:** Villa was willing to make alliances with anyone who supported his goals, regardless of their ideology.

**5. The Constitution of 1917**

*   **Radical Document:** The Constitution of 1917, drafted in the aftermath of the Revolution, was one of the most progressive constitutions of its time. It enshrined:
    *   **Article 27 (Land Reform):** Asserted the nation's ownership of all land and resources, paving the way for land redistribution. This article remains a contentious point as indigenous communities continue to seek redress for historical land seizures.
    *   **Article 123 (Labor Rights):** Guaranteed workers the right to organize, strike, and receive fair wages and working conditions. It set an eight-hour workday and prohibited child labor.
    *   **Article 3 (Secular Education):** Mandated free, secular, and compulsory education for all children.
*   **Unfulfilled Promises:** Despite its progressive ideals, the Constitution's promises have remained only partially fulfilled. Land reform has been uneven, labor rights are often violated, and access to quality education remains unequal.
*   **Encoding Ethics:** The Constitution encodes ethics by prioritizing social justice, economic equality, and the protection of vulnerable populations.

**6. José Vasconcelos and *La Raza Cósmica* (1925)**

*   ***La Raza Cósmica* ("The Cosmic Race"):** Vasconcelos, a prominent intellectual and Minister of Education, proposed a vision of Mexican identity based on *mestizaje* (racial mixing).
*   **Ethics of *Mestizaje*:** Vasconcelos argued that the mixing of races in Mexico would create a "cosmic race," a superior race that would transcend the limitations of existing races.
*   **Ethical Aspiration vs. Erasure:** While Vasconcelos's concept was intended to promote inclusivity, it has been criticized for:
    *   **Romanticizing *Mestizaje*:** Ignoring the violence and inequality inherent in the historical process of racial mixing.
    *   **Erasing Indigenous Identity:** Implying that indigenous cultures should be assimilated into a dominant *mestizo* culture.
    *   **Promoting a Hierarchy:** Suggesting that the *raza cósmica* is superior to other races.

**Conclusion**

The period from Mexican Independence through the Revolution was a formative era in Mexican ethical thought. It was marked by a struggle to define the nation's moral foundations, grappling with issues of equality, justice, sovereignty, and the role of the state. The ethical frameworks that emerged during this time—from Morelos's vision of a just society to Zapata's agrarian ethic and the Constitution of 1917—continue to shape Mexican political and social life today. However, the unfulfilled promises of the Revolution and the ongoing debates about *mestizaje* demonstrate that the quest for a just and equitable society remains an unfinished project.

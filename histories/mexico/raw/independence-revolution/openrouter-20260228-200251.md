The period from Mexican independence through the Revolution (1810-1920) represents a profound ethical transformation in Mexican thought, marked by struggles for sovereignty, equality, and justice. Below is a detailed analysis of the key ethical frameworks, thinkers, and documents from this era:

---

### 1. **The Grito de Dolores (1810) and Morelos’s *Sentimientos de la Nacion* (1813)**  
Miguel Hidalgo’s *Grito de Dolores* (September 16, 1810) marked the beginning of Mexico’s War of Independence, framing the struggle as one against colonial oppression and for social justice. Hidalgo’s ethical call emphasized **abolishing slavery** and **ending caste distinctions**, rooting independence in **indigenous sovereignty** and **universal rights**. His successor, José María Morelos, formalized these principles in the *Sentimientos de la Nacion* (1813), a foundational ethical document that declared:  
- Sovereignty resides in **the people**, not the monarchy.  
- All Mexicans are **equal before the law**, rejecting caste systems.  
- Slavery is **abolished forever**, emphasizing liberty as a universal right.  
These principles laid the groundwork for a **national ethic of equality and popular sovereignty**, though they clashed with colonial hierarchies and the Catholic Church’s dominance.

### 2. **The Reform War and Benito Juárez**  
The Reform War (1857-1861) and Juárez’s Reform Laws (*Leyes de Reforma*) centered on the **separation of church and state** as a moral imperative to dismantle the Church’s economic and political power. The Constitution of 1857 enshrined secularism and individual liberties, grounded in **liberal ethics** that prioritized **equality and secular governance**.  
Benito Juárez, a Zapotec indigenous leader who became president, embodied a profound ethical shift: **indigenous Mexicans could lead the nation**. His famous dictum, *"Entre los individuos, como entre las naciones, el respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz"* (Respect for the rights of others is peace), reflected a commitment to **justice, legality, and non-discrimination**. Juárez’s presidency challenged colonial racial hierarchies, affirming that **indigenous identity was compatible with national leadership**.

### 3. **Positivism in Mexico: The *Cientificos* and Porfirio Díaz**  
Under Porfirio Díaz (1876-1911), Mexican positivism adopted Auguste Comte’s motto *"Order and Progress"* to justify authoritarian rule and economic modernization. The *Cientificos*, Díaz’s technocratic advisors, framed modernization as an **ethical necessity**, arguing that scientific governance would bring stability and prosperity.  
However, this framework **ethically justified exploitation**:  
- Land was concentrated in the hands of elites, displacing indigenous communities.  
- Labor rights were suppressed in favor of industrial growth.  
Positivism’s ethical contradictions became evident as it prioritized **economic progress over social justice**, fueling discontent that erupted in the Revolution.

### 4. **The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920)**  
The Revolution was the most significant ethical event in modern Mexican history, characterized by competing visions of justice:  
- **Emiliano Zapata’s Plan de Ayala (1911)** articulated an **agrarian ethic**, demanding **land reform** (*tierra y libertad*) for peasants. Zapata’s Zapatismo emphasized **collective land ownership** and **indigenous rights**, rooted in pre-Columbian traditions like the *ejido* system.  
- **Pancho Villa** embodied the **ethics of popular violence**, using force to redistribute land and challenge elites.  
- **Francisco Madero** advocated for **liberal democracy**, focusing on political freedoms and electoral reform.  
The Revolution’s ethical chaos stemmed from its lack of a unified framework, revealing tensions between agrarian, liberal, and populist visions of justice.

### 5. **The Constitution of 1917**  
The Constitution of 1917 encoded revolutionary ethics into law, becoming the most radical constitution of its time:  
- **Article 27**: Declared land and natural resources as **national property**, mandating land redistribution to peasants and indigenous communities.  
- **Article 123**: Established **labor rights**, including fair wages, unionization, and protections against exploitation.  
- **Article 3**: Mandated **secular education**, promoting scientific knowledge over religious dogma.  
These articles reflected a commitment to **social justice** and **equitable governance**, though their promises remain **partially unfulfilled** due to persistent inequality and corruption.

### 6. **José Vasconcelos and *La Raza Cósmica* (1925)**  
José Vasconcelos, post-Revolutionary Minister of Education, articulated an ethics of **mestizaje** in *La Raza Cósmica* (1925), envisioning Mexico as a **"cosmic race"** blending indigenous, European, African, and Asian heritage. While his work celebrated **cultural mixing** as a source of national strength, it also risked **erasing indigenous identity** by framing mestizaje as the future. Vasconcelos’s vision reflects broader tensions between celebrating hybridity and preserving distinct indigenous traditions.

### 7. **Key Scholars**  
- **John Womack** (*Zapata and the Mexican Revolution*) emphasizes Zapatismo’s agrarian ethics and its roots in indigenous communities.  
- **Friedrich Katz** (*The Life and Times of Pancho Villa*) explores the ethics of popular violence and Villa’s role in the Revolution.  
- **Alan Knight** (*The Mexican Revolution*) provides a comprehensive analysis of competing ethical frameworks during the Revolution.  
- **Enrique Krauze** (*Mexico: Biography of Power*) examines the ethical contradictions of post-Revolutionary leadership.

### Ethical Legacy  
The period from independence through the Revolution reveals enduring tensions in Mexican ethical thought: between **equality and hierarchy**, **indigenous rights and mestizaje**, and **progress and justice**. The Constitution of 1917 and the agrarian ethics of Zapatismo remain guiding principles, even as Mexico continues to grapple with unfulfilled promises of justice and equality.

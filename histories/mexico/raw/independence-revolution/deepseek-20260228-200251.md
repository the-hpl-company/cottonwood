### **Mexican Ethical Thought from Independence through Revolution (1810–1920): A Contested Terrain of Sovereignty, Justice, and Nation**

This period constitutes a century of profound ethical convulsion, where Mexico’s intellectual and moral traditions—indigenous, colonial, liberal, and radical—clashed and synthesized in the forge of state-building and social revolution. The central ethical questions revolved around: **Who is the sovereign people? What constitutes justice after colonialism? How does a nation care for its most vulnerable—the landless, the worker, the indigenous, the poor?**

#### **1. The Grito de Dolores (1810) & The Sentimientos de la Nación (1813): An Ethical Foundation**

The insurgency initiated by **Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla** on September 16, 1810, was as much an ethical uprising as a political one. Hidalgo, a *criollo* priest steeped in Enlightenment and scholastic thought, fused popular Catholic morality with incipient nationalism. His **Grito de Dolores** invoked the Virgin of Guadalupe and decried the "bad government" of the *gachupines* (Spaniards), but its radical ethical core was its call to arms for the dispossessed—indigenous and mestizo peasants.

This ethical program was systematized by **José María Morelos y Pavón**, a priest of mixed ancestry. In the **Sentimientos de la Nación** (presented September 14, 1813, at the Congress of Chilpancingo), Morelos articulated a revolutionary ethical framework:

*   **Popular Sovereignty:** "That sovereignty springs directly from the people." (Point 1). This was a direct ethical repudiation of the divine right of kings and colonial hierarchy.
*   **Racial & Caste Equality:** "That slavery be forever prohibited, as well as the distinctions of caste, so that all shall be equal." (Points 12 & 15). This was a radical attempt to dismantle the ethical and legal architecture of New Spain, the **sistema de castas**, which codified harm based on blood purity.
*   **Universal Well-Being:** "That the laws should obligate all citizens, whether patricians or plebeians, and that they should favor the greatest possible happiness for all." (Point 23, paraphrased).

The **abolition of slavery** (decreed by Hidalgo in 1810 and enshrined by Morelos) was not merely tactical; it was an ethical declaration that the new nation could not be founded on the same fundamental harm as the old regime. Morelos’s framework was a **theologically-infused liberal republicanism**, seeking to create a political community based on collective care and dignity, explicitly inclusive of the indigenous majority.

#### **2. The Reform War & Benito Juárez: The Ethics of Secular Citizenship**

The mid-19th century saw the ethical conflict crystallize around the role of the Catholic Church as a corporate holder of power and wealth. The **Reform Laws (Leyes de Reforma, 1855-1863)**, culminating in the **Constitution of 1857**, were an ethical project to create a secular citizenry.

*   **Juárez Law (1855):** Abolished ecclesiastical and military *fueros* (legal immunities), establishing equality before the law.
*   **Lerdo Law (1856):** Forced the sale of corporate Church lands, aiming to create a class of small property owners—an ethical vision of a liberal yeomanry.
*   **Law on Civil Marriage & Registry (1859):** Secularized life events, placing them under state authority.

For **Benito Juárez**—a Zapotec lawyer from Oaxaca who became President—this was deeply personal ethics. His famous dictum, **"El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz"** ("Respect for the rights of others is peace"), encapsulates a liberal ethics of negative rights and mutual tolerance. His biography—an indigenous man leading a *mestizo* and *criollo* nation—embodied the **ethical promise of the Reform**: that the new Mexico would be a meritocracy where caste origin was irrelevant. Yet, this liberal individualism often clashed with the communal ethics of indigenous pueblos, whose lands were also vulnerable under the Lerdo Law’s emphasis on private property. The Reform’s ethics of secular citizenship was thus both emancipatory for the individual and potentially harmful to the collective.

#### **3. Positivism under Porfiriato: The Ethics of "Order and Progress"**

The regime of **Porfirio Díaz (1876-1911)** adopted **Comtean Positivism**, via the intellectual cadre of the **Científicos** (like Justo Sierra and Gabino Barreda), as its official ethical framework. The motto **"Order and Progress"** was an ethical justification for authoritarian modernization.

*   **Hierarchical Order:** Positivism’s "scientific" view of society justified a rigid hierarchy. Progress was to be directed from above by an enlightened elite (the *científicos* and Díaz himself), who "knew best." The masses, particularly indigenous communities, were seen as backward obstacles to progress.
*   **Justification of Exploitation:** This ethics translated into policies that caused profound harm: the **1883 and 1894 Land Laws** allowed survey companies to seize millions of acres of communal village lands (*ejidos*), delivering them to a handful of landowners and foreign companies. "Progress" meant railroads, mines, and export agriculture, built on the exploitation of landless labor.
*   **Ethical Erasure:** The Porfirian ethic actively sought to erase alternative ethical visions. It portrayed pre-Columbian civilizations as a glorious but dead past (museums, monuments), while contemporaneous indigenous communities were to be assimilated or eliminated. This was an ethics of **material progress at the cost of social and cultural harm**, creating the tinderbox of injustice that would fuel the Revolution.

#### **4. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920): A Clash of Ethical Visions**

The Revolution was not one event but many, a violent crucible where competing ethical frameworks fought for supremacy.

*   **Francisco I. Madero:** His **Plan de San Luis Potosí (1910)** and slogan **"Sufragio Efectivo, No Reelección"** embodied a liberal-democratic ethic. The primary harm was political: Díaz’s dictatorship. The cure was clean elections and constitutional order. This ethic proved insufficient to address the deep-seated harms of landlessness and poverty.
*   **Emiliano Zapata & Zapatismo:** The **Plan de Ayala (November 28, 1911)** is the foundational document of **agrarian ethics** in Mexico. It declared the hacienda owners "usurpers" and called for the immediate restitution of lands, forests, and waters to the villages. Its core ethic was **restorative justice**: the land must be returned to those who work it and have historic claim to it. The slogan **"Tierra y Libertad"** linked land to true freedom. Zapatismo was an ethic of **communal care and stewardship**, rooted in the indigenous and peasant tradition of the *ejido*.
*   **Pancho Villa & Northern División del Norte:** Villa’s ethic was one of **popular vengeance and redistributive justice**. Less programmatic than Zapata, his actions—expropriating haciendas, distributing goods to the poor, executing hated landlords—embodied an ethic of **retributive and distributive justice** through direct, often violent, action. As scholar **Friedrich Katz** noted, Villa’s movement was a complex blend of popular rebellion and regional ambition.
*   **Ethical Chaos:** As **Alan Knight** argues in *The Mexican Revolution*, the Revolution was "a **series of local rebellions**" with diverse motives. There was no single ethical framework, leading to profound moral ambiguity. The violence of the *Decena Trágica* or the Convention of Aguascalientes revealed the chaos when revolutionary ethics collided.

#### **5. The Constitution of 1917: Encoding Revolutionary Ethics**

The Constitution, drafted in Querétaro by victorious *carrancistas* and radical deputies, was a monumental effort to codify the victorious (but contested) ethics of the Revolution.

*   **Article 27:** Encodes the **agrarian ethic of Zapatismo**. It established the nation’s original ownership of all land and water, gave the state the right to expropriate land for public utility or to break up large estates, and mandated the creation of the *ejido*. This was a direct ethical and legal repudiation of Porfirian land policy, promising care for the landless peasant.
*   **Article 123:** Encodes the **social rights of labor**. It established the 8-hour day, minimum wage, right to organize, and right to strike. This was an ethic of **dignity and protection for the worker**, a response to the brutal exploitation of the Porfiriato.
*   **Article 3:** Mandated **secular, free, and mandatory public education**. This was an ethic of **creating a rational, unified citizenry**, free from the "fanaticism" of the Church and the ignorance of the past.

The **unfulfilled promise** is its core ethical tragedy. While these articles laid a visionary framework for social justice, their implementation was slow, partial, and often subverted by the post-revolutionary state (the PRI). Article 27 was systematically undermined until the 1992 reform that effectively ended land redistribution. The ethical gap between the constitutional text and lived reality became a defining feature of 20th-century Mexico.

#### **6. José Vasconcelos & "La Raza Cósmica" (1925): The Ethics of Mestizaje**

As the first Secretary of Public Education, **José Vasconcelos** launched a cultural mission to "redeem" the masses through art and literacy (muralism, rural schools). His book ***La Raza Cósmica*** proposed a powerful, future-oriented ethic.

*   **Ethical Aspiration:** Vasconcelos argued that Mexico (and Latin America), through *mestizaje* (racial mixing), was creating a "fifth race," a "cosmic race" that would synthesize all the virtues of the world's peoples. This was an ethic of **inclusion and synthesis**, a direct challenge to Anglo-Saxon and European racial theories of superiority. It offered a positive, unifying identity for a war-torn nation.
*   **Ethical Harm & Erasure:** The dark side of this ethic was its **teleological and assimilationist** character. For Vasconcelos, indigenous purity was a stage to be overcome; the ideal was the mixed, "spiritual" man of the future. As **Enrique Krauze** has analyzed, this "**utopia of mestizaje**" often served as an ideology for the *mestizo* state to erase indigenous particularity, demanding assimilation into a homogenous national culture as the price of inclusion. It traded the Porfirian ethic of elimination for one of absorption.

#### **7. Key Scholarly Interpretations**

*   **John Womack Jr.** (*Zapata and the Mexican Revolution*, 1969): Provides a meticulous, sympathetic account of Zapatismo’s **local, agrarian ethic**, grounding it in the specific history and desires of Morelos’s villages.
*   **Alan Knight** (*The Mexican Revolution*, 1986): Emphasizes the Revolution’s **popular, decentralized, and often anarchic** nature, challenging simplistic ideological readings and highlighting the clash of multiple ethical worlds.
*   **Friedrich Katz** (*The Life and Times of Pancho Villa*, 1998): Reveals the complex **social and economic ethics** of Villismo, showing it as more than just banditry—a popular movement with its own logic of justice.
*   **Enrique Krauze** (*Mexico: Biography of Power*, et al.): Interprets the period through the lens of **caudillos and intellectual elites**, often focusing on the gap between liberal ideals and authoritarian practices, and critiquing the "idols" of the revolutionary state.

### **Conclusion: An Unfinished Ethical Project**

The century from 1810 to 1920 saw Mexico struggle to define an ethical foundation for its nationhood. It moved from Morelos’s theologically-infused social contract, through Juárez’s secular liberalism and Díaz’s authoritarian positivism, into the fiery, contradictory ethics of revolutionary justice, finally codified in a radical but imperfect Constitution. The central, unresolved tension—between the liberal ethic of the individual citizen and the communal ethic of the indigenous and peasant village; between the promise of justice and the reality of power—remains the core of Mexico’s ethical and political landscape to this day. The Revolution did not end in 1920; its ethical battles merely moved from the battlefield to the institutions and streets of the modern state.

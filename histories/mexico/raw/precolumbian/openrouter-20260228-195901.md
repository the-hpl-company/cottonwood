### **Ethical Frameworks of Pre-Columbian Mexican Civilizations**  

#### **1. Nahua (Aztec/Mexica) Ethics: Neltiliztli, Huehuetlatolli, and In Xochitl In Cuicatl**  
The Nahua ethical ideal was **neltiliztli** ("rootedness" or "truth"), a life of balance, moderation, and wisdom. This was cultivated through **huehuetlatolli** ("speeches of the elders"), moral teachings preserved in texts like the *Codex Mendoza* and *Florentine Codex* (Book VI). These speeches instructed:  

- **Moderation**: "Do not take two portions of food when one suffices" (*Florentine Codex*, Book VI).  
- **Truth-telling**: "Let your word be straight, not crooked" (*Codex Mendoza*).  
- **Community obligation**: "You are the nose and ear of the altepetl [city-state]; do not sleep" (*huehuetlatolli* recorded by Sahagún).  

The **in xochitl in cuicatl** ("flower and song") tradition framed ethics as aesthetic-philosophical practice. Nezahualcoyotl (1402–1472), the philosopher-king of Texcoco, composed poetry on divine mystery:  
> *"Is it true one lives on earth?*  
> *Not forever on earth, only a little while here."*  
> *(Cantares Mexicanos, fol. 17r)*  

His works reflect **teotl** (sacred energy) as an ethical force—acting rightly maintained cosmic balance.  

#### **2. The Aztec Ethical Paradox: Sacrifice and Debt Payment**  
The Nahua **"debt payment" (tlahueliloc)** framework justified sacrifice: humans owed their existence to the gods (e.g., Tonatiuh, the sun, required blood to move). The *Florentine Codex* (Book III) describes this as **nextlahualiztli** ("the act of giving back"). Ethical texts simultaneously condemned *excess* violence—**tlazolli** (filth, disorder) was the true sin, not sacrifice itself.  

The **"Ethics of the Tlatoani"** in *Codex Mendoza* demanded rulers:  
- Feed the poor  
- Judge fairly  
- Lead battles *only* for just causes (e.g., punishing rebellion, not conquest for tribute alone)  

#### **3. Maya Ethics: Popol Vuh, Hero Twins, and Cyclical Obligation**  
The **Popol Vuh** (K’iche’ Maya) is a philosophical text on ethical cleverness:  
- The **Hero Twins (Hunahpu and Xbalanque)** defeat the Lords of Xibalba not through force but wit—a metaphor for ethical intelligence.  
- **K'uhul** (sacredness) required humans to "keep the days" (*Chilam Balam* texts), aligning actions with cyclical time.  

Maya stelae (e.g., Piedras Negras Stela 12) depict rulers "taking the throne" only after proving moral worth—contrasting with European divine right.  

#### **4. Zapotec and Mixtec Ethics: Codices as Moral Guides**  
- **Codex Nuttall** (Mixtec): Shows Lady 6 Monkey’s diplomacy—war is last resort.  
- **Codex Vindobonensis** (Zapotec): Priests confessing sins (like tearing a sacred mat) to restore balance.  

#### **5. Indigenous Ethical Critique of Conquest**  
The **Broken Spears (Nahuatl accounts)** condemn Spanish deceit:  
> *"They murdered us when they were already our friends."*  
> (*Annals of Tlatelolco*)  

The *Florentine Codex* (Book XII) records Nahua scholars describing conquest as **tlacatecolotl** ("monstrous evil")—a violation of **neltiliztli**.  

#### **6. Key Scholars**  
- **Miguel León-Portilla**: *Aztec Thought and Culture* (neltiliztli as philosophy).  
- **James Maffie**: *Aztec Philosophy* (teotl as metaphysical ethics).  
- **David Stuart**: Deciphering Maya moral glyphs (e.g., **"u-b’aah ti’ ajaw"**—"it is the ruler’s obligation").  

### **Conclusion**  
Pre-Columbian ethics were *not* "primitive"—they were complex systems balancing cosmic debt, community care, and intellectual rigor. The conquest attempted to erase these traditions, but their fragments demand reconstruction.

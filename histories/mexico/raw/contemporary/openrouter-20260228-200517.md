### **Mexican Ethical Thought from the Post-Revolutionary Period to the Present (1920–Present)**  

#### **1. Octavio Paz and the Ethics of Mexican Identity**  
Octavio Paz’s *El laberinto de la soledad* (1950) is a foundational text in Mexican ethical self-examination. Paz dissects the Mexican psyche through archetypes:  

- **"La máscara" (the mask)** – The Mexican hides behind stoicism, humor, or aggression to shield vulnerability, a colonial inheritance of distrust.  
- **The pachuco** – The Mexican-American youth who rejects assimilation yet remains alienated, embodying the ethical crisis of belonging.  
- **Malinche and "la chingada"** – Malinche (Nahua interpreter for Cortés) symbolizes betrayal, but also the violated Indigenous mother. The *chingada* (the violated one) reflects Mexico’s ethical wound: conquest as gendered violence.  
- **Machismo** – Not just male dominance, but a defensive posture against historical humiliation.  

Paz’s ethics demand confronting historical trauma—a theme later expanded by Roger Bartra (*La jaula de la melancolía*, 1987), who argues Mexican identity is a constructed myth masking unresolved colonial violence.

#### **2. Zapatismo (EZLN) and Indigenous Ethical Autonomy**  
The 1994 Zapatista uprising redefined Mexican ethics through Indigenous frameworks:  

- **"Para todos, todo. Para nosotros, nada."** – The EZLN’s demand for dignity, not power, echoes Nahua *tlamatiliztli* (wisdom) and communal reciprocity (*tequio*).  
- **Subcomandante Marcos’s communiqués** – Blending Mayan cosmovision with Marxist critique, e.g., *"La historia de las preguntas"* (1999), framing justice as collective questioning.  
- **Juntas de Buen Gobierno (2003–present)** – Autonomous councils practicing *mandar obedeciendo* (leading by obeying), a Mixe-Zapotec principle.  
- **Caracoles** – "Snail" community centers symbolizing slow, deliberate ethical transformation.  

Neo-Zapatismo rejects the state’s monopoly on ethics, reviving pre-Columbian concepts like *ixiptla* (the representative who serves, not rules).

#### **3. Liberation Theology and Indigenous Rights**  
Bishop Samuel Ruiz (San Cristóbal de las Casas) applied liberation theology’s "preferential option for the poor" to Mexico’s Indigenous:  

- **Diocese of San Cristóbal (1960–1999)** – Ruiz’s *teología india* incorporated Tzotzil and Tzeltal cosmologies, redefining sin as structural oppression.  
- **San Andrés Accords (1996)** – A Church-mediated pact recognizing Indigenous self-governance, later betrayed by the state.  
- **The Church’s ethical paradox** – While Ruiz sided with the oppressed, the institutional Church often upheld colonial hierarchies.

#### **4. Femicide and the Ethics of Gender Violence**  
The crisis of feminicide (*feminicidio*) exposes Mexico’s ethical failures:  

- **Ciudad Juárez (1993–present)** – Over 1,500 women murdered in Juárez alone, many maquiladora workers—disposable under global capitalism.  
- **"Ni una más"** – The 2004 protest slogan, later echoed in the 2020 *Un Día Sin Nosotras* strike, where millions of women vanished from public life to protest violence.  
- **Elena Poniatowska’s *Las mil y una... La herida de Paulina* (2000)** – Chronicles systemic impunity for gender violence.  

The ethical response has been grassroots: feminist collectives like *Las Morras* in Chihuahua or *Brujas del Mar* in Veracruz reclaiming public space.

#### **5. Narco-Ethics and the Failed State**  
The drug war (2006–present) has forced Mexicans to navigate parallel moral systems:  

- **Narco-corridos** – Songs like *"Contrabando y Traición"* (Los Tigres del Norte, 1974) dramatize loyalty and betrayal in a lawless world.  
- **Ayotzinapa (2014)** – The disappearance of 43 students exposed state-cartel collusion. The parents’ slogan, *"Fue el estado"*, became an ethical indictment.  
- **Self-defense militias (2013–present)** – Groups like *Autodefensas de Michoacán* arose where the state failed, raising ethical questions about vigilantism.  

Claudio Lomnitz (*Death and the Idea of Mexico*, 2005) argues narco-violence forces a national reckoning with mortality as a cultural ethic.

#### **6. The Border as Ethical Space**  
Mexican migration ethics challenge nationalism:  

- **Gloria Anzaldúa’s *Borderlands/La Frontera* (1987)** – The border as a site of *mestizaje* (hybridity) and ethical resistance.  
- **Remittances ($60 billion/year)** – Migrants’ economic support is an ethical obligation (*familismo*), yet exploits their labor.  
- **"El otro México"** – The 38 million Mexican-Americans (2020) complicate national identity, as seen in the 2006 pro-migrant protests (*"Somos mexicanos"*).  

---  

#### **7. Contemporary Ethical Thinkers**  
- **Enrique Dussel** – *Ética de la Liberación* (1998) frames ethics as resistance to coloniality.  
- **Boaventura de Sousa Santos** – His *Epistemologías del Sur* (2009) influences Mexican decolonial movements.  
- **AMLO’s "Cuarta Transformación"** – Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s 2018 claim to ethical renewal, though criticized for militarization.  

---  

### **Conclusion**  
Mexican ethics today is a battleground—between Indigenous autonomy and state violence, feminist resistance and patriarchal impunity, narco-power and communal survival. The tradition demands not just analysis, but *acción ética*—ethical action in the face of systemic harm.

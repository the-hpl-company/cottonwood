# Mexican Ethical Thought (1920–Present): A Post-Revolutionary Labyrinth

## 1. Octavio Paz and the Ethics of Mexican Identity
**Octavio Paz’s *El laberinto de la soledad* (1950)** stands as the foundational text of post-revolutionary Mexican self-examination. Paz diagnoses a national psyche built on **“la máscara”**—the mask that hides a vulnerable, solitary self. This masking is not merely psychological but ethical: it creates a **“hermetism”** that prevents authentic encounter with the Other. 

Paz’s ethical archetypes:
- **The Pachuco** (1940s zoot-suiter): Embodies the Mexican who rejects both Mexican and American identity, living in a **“solitude of rebellion”** that prefigures later borderland identities.
- **La Chingada** and **Malinche**: The violated mother (La Malinche/Doña Marina) becomes the **“fundamental myth”** of Mexican betrayal and hybridity. Paz controversially frames this as a national **“original sin”** that underpins *machismo*—the hypermasculine ethic of domination and closure. *Machismo* is analyzed as an **ethical failure**: a compensatory performance that denies vulnerability and relationality.

Paz’s project is an **ethics of unmasking**: to move from solitude to communion, from historical fatalism to conscious responsibility. His later work, *Posdata* (1970), directly ties this to the **1968 Tlatelolco massacre**, where the state’s mask of revolutionary legitimacy shattered.

## 2. Neo-Zapatismo: Indigenous Autonomy as Ethical Framework
The **EZLN uprising on January 1, 1994** (NAFTA’s enactment day) marked a seismic shift in Mexican political ethics. **Subcomandante Marcos’s communiqués** (1994–2014) are a corpus of ethical literature blending Mayan cosmology, liberation theology, and postmodern critique. 

Core ethical principles:
- **“Para todos, todo. Para nosotros, nada.”**: A radical ethics of reciprocity and anti-accumulation.
- **“Mandar obedeciendo”** (to lead by obeying): An inversion of hierarchical power, operationalized through **Juntas de Buen Gobierno** (Good Government Councils, established 2003) in the **Caracoles** (spiral-shell centers). These are **applied ethics**—rotating, unpaid, recallable leadership that practices *servicio* (service) not *poder* (power).

**Connection to Nahua ethics**: The Zapatista *autonomía* echoes the **Nahua *altepetl*** (water-mountain community) as a self-governing moral universe. The concept of **“tequio”** (communal labor) and **“cargo”** (rotating service) are revived. The **“world where many worlds fit”** mirrors the Mesoamerican pluralistic cosmology seen in the **Florentine Codex’s** “in ixtli, in yollotl” (face, heart) — the ethical pursuit of rooted yet dialogical identity.

## 3. Liberation Theology: Samuel Ruiz and the Preferential Option for the Poor
**Bishop Samuel Ruiz García** (San Cristóbal de las Casas, 1960–2000) incarnated liberation theology in Mexico. His **“pastoral indígena”** transformed the diocese into a **“voice of the voiceless.”** Ruiz’s ethical method: **“caminar con el pueblo”** (walking with the people), listening to indigenous communities’ *teología india* (Indian theology).

Key ethical interventions:
- **Mediation in the 1994 uprising**: Ruiz’s moral authority made him a credible broker.
- **The San Andrés Accords (1996)**: Ruiz’s team helped draft the agreements on indigenous rights and culture, later betrayed by the state’s 2001 constitutional reform.
- **Exodus 3:7–8 as ethical lens**: God’s “seeing the affliction” of the oppressed became a mandate for **structural sin analysis**—linking poverty to land dispossession, racism, and neoliberal policy.

Ruiz’s church became a **“sanctuary ethics”** practice, protecting refugees from Central America and displaced communities. This **“Church of the Poor”** stood in tension with the institutional hierarchy, embodying the **“dangerous memory”** of Bartolomé de las Casas.

## 4. Femicide: Systemic Violence as Ethical Collapse
**Ciudad Juárez feminicidios** (escalating from 1993) exposed an **ethics of disposable life**. The **maquiladora system** created a gendered labor regime where young women’s bodies were both exploited economically and violated physically. 

Ethical responses:
- **“Ni una más”** (Not one more): The slogan coined by activist **Esther Chávez Cano** (1995) became a national movement.
- **Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa** (2001): Founded by Norma Andrade, demanding state accountability.
- **The 2020 feminist protests**: After the brutal murders of **Ingrid Escamilla** and **Fátima Aldrighett**, protesters painted the **Ángel de la Independencia** in pink—symbolizing the state’s **“ethical bankruptcy.”** The cry **“¡Nos están matando!”** (They are killing us!) indicts the **“normalization”** of gender violence traced to colonial *machismo* and neoliberal dehumanization.

Scholar **Rita Segato** (Argentine-Mexican) analyzes this as **“pedagogy of cruelty”**—a systemic desensitization where feminicide is a **“message crime”** reinforcing patriarchal territorial control.

## 5. Narco-Ethics and the Failed State
The **“drug war”** launched by President Felipe Calderón (2006) triggered an **ethical catastrophe**: over 350,000 homicides (2006–2022), 100,000+ disappeared. 

Key ethical crises:
- **Ayotzinapa (2014)**: The enforced disappearance of 43 students from the **Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teachers’ College** revealed **state-criminal collusion** (the “**verdad histórica**” later debunked). The school’s **socialist ethics** (founded 1926) clashed with the state’s **ethics of impunity**.
- **Narco-corridos as ethical commentary**: Songs like **“Los Tigres del Norte’s *La Reina del Sur***” (2002) or **Chalino Sánchez’s *Nieves de Enero*** (1992) narrate a **parallel moral universe** where loyalty, betrayal, and vengeance operate outside state law. They are **“counter-ethics”** documenting the collapse of the social contract.
- **Community self-defense**: The **Autodefensas** movement (2013 in Michoacán) and **“policía comunitaria”** in Guerrero reflect **grassroots ethical frameworks** where protection of the vulnerable is reclaimed when the state is perpetrator or absent.

## 6. The Border as Ethical Space
**Gloria Anzaldúa’s *Borderlands/La Frontera* (1987)** theorizes the border as **“una herida abierta”** (an open wound) but also a **“mestiza consciousness”**—an ethical stance of tolerance for ambiguity. 

Mexican-side migration ethics:
- **“El otro México”**: The 38 million **mexicanos en Estados Unidos** (2020) create a **transnational ethical community**. Remittances ($60.3 billion in 2023) are framed as **“familial obligation”** but also expose dependency on exportable labor.
- **Casa del Migrante shelters** (e.g., **Saltillo, Tapachula**): Run by religious orders, they practice a **“ethics of sanctuary”** amid the **“industry of migration control.”**
- **The 2018–2024 caravans**: Collective migration as **“ethical protest”** against border militarization and the **“right to not migrate”** demanded by Central American activists.

## 7. Contemporary Thinkers and Movements
- **Enrique Dussel**: His **Philosophy of Liberation** (1970s–present) critiques Eurocentric modernity from the **“exteriority”** of the oppressed. In *Ética de la Liberación* (1998), he proposes an **“ethics of life”** against the **“ethics of the system.”** His concept of **“analectical”** (from the Other) dialogue influences Zapatista thought.
- **Boaventura de Sousa Santos’s influence**: His **“epistemologies of the South”** and **“subaltern cosmopolitanism”** resonate with Mexican indigenous movements’ **“saberes locales”** (local knowledges).
- **Indigenous philosophy movements**: **Carlos Lenkersdorf’s** work on **Tojolabal *nosotros*** (collective “we”), **Maya *ilb’al* (word-thought-action)**, and the **Grupo de Estudios sobre Filosofía Náhuatl** (UNAM) recover pre-Columbian ethics.
- **AMLO’s “Cuarta Transformación”** (2018–present): Andrés Manuel López Obrador frames his presidency as a **“moral regeneration”** against neoliberalism’s **“ethics of greed.”** Critics (e.g., **Jorge G. Castañeda**) see a **“populist ethics”** that centralizes power while invoking **“fraternity and love”** (*abrazos, no balazos*).

## 8. Key Scholars
- **Claudio Lomnitz**: *Deep Mexico, Silent Mexico* (2001) analyzes the **“intimate publics”** where national ethics are negotiated. His *Death and the Idea of Mexico* (2005) traces the **cult of death** as an ethical response to historical trauma.
- **Roger Bartra**: *La jaula de la melancolía* (1987) deconstructs the **“mythical Mexican”** (the *pelado*, the *china poblana*) as ideological constructs that mask power relations.
- **Elena Poniatowska**: *La noche de Tlatelolco* (1971) pioneers **testimonial ethics**—giving voice to the 1968 massacre’s victims. Her *Hasta no verte Jesús mío* (1969) and work on the **1985 earthquake** practice an **ethics of listening** to subaltern subjects.

---

**Conclusion**: Mexican ethical thought since 1920 is a **labyrinth of solitudes and solidarities**. It moves from Paz’s existential individualism to Zapatista communitarianism, from state-centric revolutionary ethics to grassroots *autogestión* (self-management). The enduring tension: how to build an **ethics of care** in a landscape shaped by conquest, revolution, neoliberal dispossession, and narco-capitalism. The answer, perhaps, lies in the **“caracol”**—the spiral that listens inward to ancestral wisdom while opening outward to a wounded world.

# The Colonial Period (c. 1534–1867): Canada’s Foundational Ethical Tensions

The colonial period established the enduring ethical architecture of Canada—a structure built on **asymmetrical recognition, layered sovereignties, and the persistent gap between covenant and coercion**. This is not a prelude to nationhood but the active construction of a moral order defined by its internal contradictions.

## 1. New France & Catholic Ethics: Conversion, Feudalism, and Cultural Crossing

**The Jesuit Relations (1632–1673)** are foundational ethical–ethnographic texts. Jesuit observers like Jean de Brébeuf documented Huron-Wendat (Ouendat) ethics: communal ownership, restorative justice, consensus governance, and a spiritual reciprocity with the land. Brébeuf wrote of Huron generosity: “They think they are bound to assist each other… the whole village must bear the burden” (Relation of 1636). The Jesuits sought to replace this with a **hierarchical, sin–redemption framework** and individual salvation. Their mission was an ethical transplantation: replacing relational kinship with vertical devotion.

**Marie de l’Incarnation** (1599–1672), founder of the Ursuline school in Quebec (1639), framed education as an ethical act of “saving souls” through linguistic and cultural immersion. Her letters reveal a tension: genuine care for Indigenous girls alongside a conviction that their cultures were “without faith, without law, without king” — a **paternalistic care that required erasure**.

The **seigneurial system** (established by the Company of One Hundred Associates, 1627) transplanted feudal ethics: mutual obligation between seigneur and habitant, with rights to land contingent on duties to the crown. This created a **hierarchical, stable social order** contrasted with English individualist settlement.

The **coureurs des bois** (and later voyageurs) operated outside this frame, engaging in a **practical ethics of cultural crossing**: learning languages, adopting Indigenous technologies (snowshoes, canoes), and often forming *métissage* (kinship) alliances. Their existence embodied a tension: economic and social integration versus the official colonial ethics of separation and conversion.

## 2. The Royal Proclamation of 1763: The Covenant Framework & Its Violations

The **Royal Proclamation (October 7, 1763)** is the cornerstone of Crown–Indigenous relations and Canada’s most important colonial ethical document. It established:
- Indigenous title to land as existing until **ceded by treaty** to the Crown.
- A prohibition on private purchase of Indigenous lands (reserving this to the Crown).
- A “protected” Indigenous territory west of the Appalachians (and later, west of Upper Canada).

Ethically, it framed the relationship as a **fiduciary obligation** — the Crown as protector, with Indigenous nations as sovereign treaty partners. The Proclamation’s preamble states it was issued to prevent “Frauds and Abuses” against Indigenous peoples. This created the **doctrine of the treaty relationship**: not a mere real-estate transaction but a perpetual covenant of peace, friendship, and mutual respect.

**Violations began immediately**:
- The **Haldimand Proclamation (1784)** granting the Six Nations land along the Grand River was subsequently encroached upon by settlers.
- The **Robinson Treaties (1850)** and later **Numbered Treaties** often ignored the Proclamation’s requirement of full, prior consent.
- The **Indian Act (1876)** systematically undermined the sovereign-to-sovereign relationship the Proclamation envisioned.

Yet, the Proclamation remains cited in Section 25 of the **Constitution Act, 1982**, and upheld by the Supreme Court (e.g., *R. v. Sioui*, 1990). Its ethical power lies in its **unfulfilled promise** — a benchmark of Crown obligation constantly betrayed.

## 3. The Quebec Act (1774): The Ethics of Accommodation

The **Quebec Act** preserved French civil law, Catholic emancipation (allowing Catholics to hold public office), and the seigneurial land tenure system in conquered New France. Britain’s motivation was **strategic pacification** — to secure French-Canadian loyalty against the restive American colonies.

Ethically, it established a **Canadian tradition of accommodation** — not out of pluralist idealism, but from **necessity and statecraft**. It accepted that a conquered people could retain core civil and religious institutions, creating a **bi-juridical and bi-national reality** at the heart of the colony. This directly contradicted the American melting-pot ideal and set a precedent for **asymmetrical federalism**. Lord Durham would later condemn it as “a mistake” that perpetuated “a people without a history,” but its ethical legacy is the grudging recognition that stability sometimes requires accepting difference.

## 4. The War of 1812 & Loyalist Ethics: Tory Paternalism vs. Republicanism

The **United Empire Loyalists** (approx. 60,000 arriving 1783–1812) embodied a counter-revolutionary ethic. They rejected American republicanism’s “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” for a **hierarchical, monarchical vision** of “peace, order, and good government.” Loyalism encoded:
- **Obedience to authority** as a civic virtue.
- **Collective stability** over individual liberty.
- **Gradual, organic reform** rather than revolutionary change.

This **Tory paternalist ethic** shaped Upper Canada’s ruling **Family Compact** and found intellectual expression in thinkers like **John Strachan** (1778–1867), who defended an established church and elite rule as necessary for moral order. The War of 1812 cemented this identity: Canada as a **British counterweight to American individualism**, where rights flowed from the Crown, not from the people. This ethical framework justified hierarchy and delayed democratic reforms, leading directly to the rebellions of 1837–38.

## 5. The Rebellions of 1837–38 & the Durham Report: Two Nations, One State

The rebellions presented two distinct ethical visions:

- **Lower Canada (Louis-Joseph Papineau)**: The *Patriote* movement sought democratic reform and **French-Canadian national survival** against British colonial oligarchy. Their *92 Resolutions (1834)* demanded responsible government and linguistic equality. Their ethic was **republican and national** — inspired by the American and French revolutions, but focused on *la survivance*.

- **Upper Canada (William Lyon Mackenzie)**: Influenced by Jacksonian democracy, Mackenzie’s ethic was **agrarian populist and anti-clerical**, targeting the Family Compact’s monopoly on land and power. His *Seventh Report on Grievances (1835)* denounced privilege and demanded elected control over revenues.

Both rebellions were crushed militarily. Lord Durham’s **Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)** diagnosed “two nations warring in the bosom of a single state.” His ethical solution was **assimilation**: unite the Canadas and swamp the French with English settlement to create a single, Anglophone polity. He wrote: “I entertain no doubts of the national character which must be given to Lower Canada; it must be that of the British Empire… that of the great race which must… prevail on this continent.”

The **Act of Union (1841)** implemented union but failed to assimilate French Canadians. The ethical compromise that emerged was **responsible government** (achieved 1848) — a parliamentary system where the executive is accountable to the elected legislature. This was a **British-style liberal ethic** of gradual reform, rejecting both American republicanism and Durham’s forced assimilation. It entrenched a pattern: **political accommodation without cultural equality**.

## 6. The Indian Act (1876): The Ethics of Wardship & Assimilation

The **Indian Act (1876)**, consolidating earlier colonial ordinances (e.g., the *Gradual Civilization Act, 1857*), is the most potent instrument of colonial ethical engineering. It encoded:
- **Status and non-status** definitions, determining who is legally “Indian.”
- **Band governance** under federal supervision, replacing traditional systems.
- **Reserve system** as places of confinement and control.
- **The pass system** (extra-legal but enforced 1885–1940s) restricting movement off-reserve.
- **Potlatch and Sun Dance bans (1884)** — criminalizing Indigenous spiritual and governance practices.
- **Enfranchisement** as the loss of status upon gaining education, property, or voting rights.

The Act’s ethical framework is **paternalistic wardship**: Indigenous peoples were deemed “children” of the state, requiring protection (from themselves and from settlers) and compulsory civilization. It operationalized the **doctrine of assimilation** — the “civilizing mission” that sought to “kill the Indian in the child.” It remains in force today, a living monument to colonial control, amended but never repealed.

## 7. The Numbered Treaties (1871–1921): Asymmetric Covenant

Treaties 1 through 11 were signed under radically asymmetric power. The Crown’s motive was **secure access to land for settlement and resource extraction**, especially after Canadian Confederation (1867). Indigenous motives, as recorded orally, were **survival and the preservation of a relationship**.

- **Treaty 1 (1871, Stone Fort Treaty)**: The written text promised reserves, farming tools, and annual payments. Oral promises of livestock, carts, and ammunition (“outside promises”) were omitted from the text and later had to be renegotiated.
- **Treaty 6 (1876)**: Included a **medicine chest clause** — interpreted by Indigenous signatories as a guarantee of healthcare, a profound ethical commitment to collective well-being.
- **Treaty 7 (1877)**: Blackfoot leaders understood it as a peace and sharing agreement, not a land surrender. Commissioner David Laird’s account emphasizes “the Queen’s law” and protection.

The ethical tension is between **treaty as living relationship** (the Indigenous understanding, grounded in oral history and ceremony, of a perpetual covenant of mutual care and shared land) and **treaty as finalized contract** (the Crown’s written, narrow interpretation limiting obligations to specific goods and land transfers). Scholar **J.R. Miller** frames this as **“Compact, Contract, Covenant”** — with the Crown emphasizing contract, Indigenous nations emphasizing covenant, and the compact being the unstable, contested middle ground.

## 8. Key Scholarly Frames

- **Allan Greer** (*Property and Dispossession*, 2018): Traces how European property ethics (individual, exclusive ownership) clashed with and displaced Indigenous relational land tenure.
- **John Dickinson** (& Brian Young, *A Short History of Quebec*, 4th ed., 2008): Emphasizes the **duality of Quebec’s ethical development** — Catholic communitarianism vs. liberal individualism.
- **Olive Patricia Dickason** (*Canada’s First Nations*, 1992): Grounds Canadian history in Indigenous civilizations and frames contact as a clash of sovereign worlds.
- **J.R. Miller** (*Compact, Contract, Covenant*, 2009): Provides the definitive framework for understanding treaty relationships as ethical paradigms, highlighting the gap between Indigenous and Crown interpretations.

## Conclusion: The Foundational Ethical Tension

The colonial period bequeathed to Canada a **schizophrenic ethical tradition**:
- A **covenantal strand**: The Royal Proclamation’s recognition, the treaty relationship, the accommodation of Quebec — all acknowledging plural sovereignties and obligations to the vulnerable.
- A **coercive strand**: The Indian Act’s assimilation, Durham’s cultural supremacy, the treaty violations, the Loyalist hierarchy — all enforcing conformity and colonial control.

The Canadian ethical project has been the unstable, often violent, negotiation between these two strands. The gap between **covenant and coercion** is not an accident; it is the foundational Canadian condition.

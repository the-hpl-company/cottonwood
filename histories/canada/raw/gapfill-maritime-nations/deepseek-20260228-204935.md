### **Ethical Traditions of the Wabanaki Confederacy and the Maritimes**

**1. The Wabanaki Confederacy: An Ethical and Political Architecture**
The Wabanaki Confederacy (Dawnland Confederacy) is a longstanding alliance of Algonquian-speaking nations—Mi’kmaq, Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, and Abenaki. Its ethical core is encapsulated in the concept of *allies*, not a centralized state, bound by mutual protection, diplomacy, and shared stewardship of their territories. Governance was deliberative, with decisions requiring consensus among constituent nations. The confederacy’s constitutional records are physical: wampum belts encoding agreements, histories, and laws through intricate patterns of purple and white shell beads. The *Guswenta* (Two Row Wampum) principle of parallel, non-interfering coexistence was central to its diplomatic philosophy.

The relationship with the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy to the west was historically complex, marked by both periods of conflict and formal peace. A pivotal ethical-political document is the *Treaty of 1760*, symbolized by the *Treaty of Peace and Friendship Wampum Belt*, negotiated between the Wabanaki and Haudenosaunee with British mediation. This belt, depicting linked figures under a pine tree (the Tree of Peace), established a formal peace and recognized mutual territories, ending a prolonged war. This demonstrates the Wabanaki Confederacy’s sophisticated, record-keeping diplomacy on equal footing with other major Indigenous power structures.

**2. The Peace and Friendship Treaties (1725-1779): A Covenant of Coexistence**
Unlike later land cession treaties in Canada, the Maritimes’ *Peace and Friendship Treaties* are foundational ethical-compacts of mutual respect, non-interference, and shared use of resources. The *Treaty of 1752* (signed 22 November 1752) between the British and the Shubenacadie Mi’kmaq is archetypal. It explicitly states the Mi’kmaq “shall not be hindered from, but have free liberty of Hunting & Fishing as usual” and that the parties would “forget all that has passed.” It established a legal relationship of peace, not surrender.

This treaty’s modern affirmation came in *R. v. Marshall (No. 1) [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456*. The Supreme Court of Canada, interpreting the 1760-61 treaties, recognized a Mi’kmaq treaty right to hunt, fish, and gather for a “moderate livelihood,” deriving from the “trade clause” in the treaties. The Court held the Crown had obtained peace and friendship in exchange for guaranteeing access to necessaries through trade. This decision was a seismic reassertion of the treaties’ enduring ethical and legal force.

The *Burnt Church Crisis (1999-2002)* that followed exposed the chasm between this legal affirmation and settler acceptance. Mi’kmaq fishers exercising their affirmed rights at Burnt Church, New Brunswick, faced violent confrontations, vandalism, and arson from non-Indigenous commercial fishers, while police were often passive. The crisis laid bare the ongoing resistance to the ethical premise of the treaties: shared access and coexistence.

**3. Mi’kmaq Ethical Traditions: Netukulimk and the Sante’ Mawio’mi**
The Mi’kmaq ethical system is governed by *Netukulimk*, a complex principle of stewardship mandating the sustainable use of the natural world (**Netukulimk** ) for community well-being without compromising the integrity, diversity, or productivity of the environment for future generations. It is a legal and spiritual obligation, not merely an economic practice.

The *Sante’ Mawio’mi* (Grand Council) is the traditional government of the Mi’kmaq Nation, comprising *Keptinaq* (district captains), elders, and the *Kji-Saqmaw* (Grand Chief). It is one of the oldest continuously functioning representative governments in North America. Its authority is derived from and recorded in wampum belts like the *Mawi Watu (The Great Law)* belt, which outlines the council’s structure and responsibilities. The Grand Council was the signatory to the Peace and Friendship Treaties, and it continues to assert its role as the legitimate governing authority for the Mi’kmaq people, challenging the imposed Indian Act band council system.

**4. The Mi’kmaq-Acadian Relationship: An Ethical Alliance**
The 17th-18th century relationship between Mi’kmaq and Acadians was a rare North American example of largely peaceful, mutually beneficial cohabitation. Acadians, as French colonists who often adopted a neutral political stance, settled on unused tidal marshes without displacing Mi’kmaq villages. The peoples intermarried, traded, and formed military alliances. Ethically, this relationship was based on practical reciprocity and respect, rather than domination or assimilation. This alliance made the Mi’kmaq steadfast defenders of Acadia during the Anglo-French colonial wars. Following the British conquest of Acadia and the subsequent *Great Expulsion (1755-1764)*, many Mi’kmaq sheltered and integrated Acadian refugees, deepening kinship ties. This history stands in stark contrast to the violent dispossession that characterized British-Mi’kmaq relations.

**5. Contemporary Conflicts: The Unfinished Implementation of Treaty Ethics**
The ethical and legal promises of the Peace and Friendship Treaties remain a site of intense struggle. The *2020 crisis in Nova Scotia* over the Mi’kmaq “moderate livelihood” fishery, stemming from the *Marshall* decision, is a direct continuation. When Sipekne’katik First Nation launched its self-regulated fishery outside the federal commercial season in September 2020, asserting its treaty right, non-Indigenous fishers and supporters responded with blockades, threats, and the burning of two Mi’kmaq lobster pounds in Middle West Pubnico (October 2020). The RCMP was criticized for failing to protect Mi’kmaq fishers and property.

This violence underscores the core, unresolved tension: the settler state and commercial interests continue to treat the fishery as an exclusive, Crown-regulated industry, while Mi’kmaq legal traditions and the Supreme Court affirm a pre-existing, treaty-protected right to a *moderate livelihood*—a concept rooted in *Netukulimk* and the treaty covenant of shared use. The federal government’s failure to clearly define and protect this right has perpetuated conflict, betraying the ethical spirit of the treaties.

**6. Key Scholarly Interpretations**
*   **Daniel N. Paul** (*We Were Not the Savages*, 1993) provides a Mi’kmaq-centered historical narrative that directly challenges colonial historiography, detailing the violence of British “pacification” policies and ethically reframing Mi’kmaq resistance as a defense of homeland and sovereignty.
*   **William C. Wicken** (*Mi’kmaq Treaties on Trial: History, Land, and Donald Marshall Junior*, 2002) offers crucial historical anthropology, using 18th-century court records to reconstruct Mi’kmaq societal norms and treaty understandings, which became foundational to the *Marshall* case.
*   **Harald E.L. Prins** (*The Mi’kmaq: Resistance, Accommodation, and Cultural Survival*, 1996) analyzes Mi’kmaq agency and political adaptability through centuries of colonial pressure, emphasizing the persistence of their ethical and political structures like the Grand Council.

**Conclusion**
The ethical traditions of the Wabanaki Confederacy, centered on alliance, sustainable stewardship (*Netukulimk*), and covenant-based diplomacy (wampum belts, Peace and Friendship Treaties), represent a profound and enduring legal-philosophical system. The ongoing conflicts over fishery rights are not mere “resource disputes” but are fundamentally clashes between a worldview of exclusive ownership and one of shared reciprocal obligation—a clash between the broken promises of the Crown and the living, asserted ethics of the treaties. The polite narrative of Canada obscures this persistent, often violent, resistance to implementing the nation-to-nation relationship these traditions embody.

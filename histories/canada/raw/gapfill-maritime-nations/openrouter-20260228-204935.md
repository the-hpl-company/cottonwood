### Ethical Traditions of the Wabanaki Confederacy and Mi'kmaq Netukulimk  

#### **1. The Wabanaki Confederacy as Ethical and Political Architecture**  
The Wabanaki Confederacy (Dawnland Confederacy) united the Mi'kmaq, Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, and Abenaki nations in a reciprocal alliance predating European contact. Unlike the Haudenosaunee Confederacy's Great Law of Peace, Wabanaki governance emphasized fluid diplomacy through **wampum belts**—mnemonic treaties encoding agreements like the **1701 Treaty of Portsmouth** (renewing peace with the Haudenosaunee after centuries of conflict). The **Kaswentha (Two-Row Wampum)** principle of parallel coexistence informed Wabanaki-Haudenosaunee relations, though tensions persisted, as seen in the **1603 Tadoussac peace negotiations** between Mi'kmaq and Mohawk (documented by French Jesuit Pierre Biard).  

#### **2. Peace and Friendship Treaties (1725–1779): Living Agreements**  
The **1725–26 Treaty of Boston** and **1752 Treaty of Halifax** (signed by Jean-Baptiste Cope for the Mi'kmaq) established **non-ceded shared land use**, rejecting British sovereignty claims. These treaties were upheld in **R. v. Marshall (1999)**, where the Supreme Court affirmed Mi'kmaq treaty rights to a "moderate livelihood" fishery. The subsequent **Burnt Church Crisis (1999–2000)**—where non-Indigenous fishers burned Mi'kmaq lobster traps—exposed settler resistance to treaty implementation.  

#### **3. Netukulimk and Mi'kmaq Governance**  
**Netukulimk**, the Mi'kmaq ethical-legal framework, mandates sustainable resource use, as codified in wampum like the **1794 Jay Treaty belts**. The **Mi'kmaq Grand Council (Sante Mawio'mi)**, operating since pre-contact, remains a functioning government, challenging Canada's imposition of the Indian Act (1876). Scholar William Wicken (*Mi'kmaq Treaties on Trial*, 2002) documents how colonial courts deliberately misinterpreted oral treaty terms.  

#### **4. Mi'kmaq-Acadian Alliances**  
The **Mi'kmaq-Acadian alliance (1604–1755)** was rooted in intermarriage (e.g., the **Mius family**) and mutual aid against British expulsion. Acadian leader **Joseph Broussard** fought alongside Mi'kmaq in resistance campaigns like the **1749 Battle at Chignecto**. This solidarity contrasts with the **1755 Acadian Expulsion**, where Mi'kmaq sheltered refugees—an ethical act absent from most settler narratives.  

#### **5. Contemporary Struggles: Treaty Rights vs. Settler Backlash**  
The **2020 Shubenacadie River dispute** saw Mi'kmaq fishers asserting treaty rights amid violent opposition (e.g., **lobster pound arson**). The **1999 Marshall decision**'s unmet promise—federal refusal to define "moderate livelihood"—reveals Canada’s bad faith, as critiqued by Mi'kmaq historian Daniel Paul (*We Were Not the Savages*, 2000).

This history dismantles the "polite Canada" myth, showing **unceded Wabanaki sovereignty** and **state-sanctioned violence** when Indigenous rights are exercised.

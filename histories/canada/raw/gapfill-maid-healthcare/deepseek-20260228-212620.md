### **Canadian Healthcare Ethics: Medicare, MAID, and the Unfinished Project of Universal Care**

The Canadian healthcare ethics tradition is defined by a foundational, yet perpetually contested, commitment to healthcare as a public good rather than a market commodity. This tradition, born in political struggle and refined through constitutional litigation, centers on two profound ethical questions: the right to access care, and the right to refuse it. The tension between the collective solidarity of medicare and the individual autonomy underpinning Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) reveals a system grappling with its own principles amidst practical failure.

#### **1. The Birth of Medicare: Healthcare as a Right, Not a Commodity**
The ethical architecture of Canadian medicare was forged in Saskatchewan. Premier **Tommy Douglas’s Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) government** passed the **Saskatchewan Hospital Insurance Act (1947)**, establishing the first provincial hospital insurance plan. The more radical leap was the **Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (1962)**, creating a single-payer, universal insurance plan for physician services.

This provoked the **Saskatchewan doctors’ strike (July 1–23, 1962)**, a seminal conflict framing healthcare as a clash of rights: the state’s right to provide collective social security versus physicians’ right to private practice and fee-for-service billing. The strike ended with a compromise (the Saskatoon Agreement), but the principle of public, universal insurance was entrenched.

The federal **Royal Commission on Health Services (the Hall Commission, 1964)** nationalized this ethical vision, concluding that “the achievement of the highest possible health standards for all our people must become a primary objective of national policy.” This led to the **Medical Care Act (1966)**, which used federal spending power to create a national cost-shared program, and its successor, the **Canada Health Act (1984)**.

The **Canada Health Act’s five principles** codify the ethical framework:
*   **Public Administration:** Non-profit administration by a public authority.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** Coverage of all “medically necessary” services.
*   **Universality:** Coverage for all residents.
*   **Portability:** Coverage across provinces.
*   **Accessibility:** Reasonable access unimpeded by financial or other barriers.

The core ethic, as scholar **Colleen Flood** has argued, is that of **social citizenship**: healthcare is a precondition for equal membership in society, and financial barriers to care are morally indefensible.

#### **2. The Crisis of Medicare: The Ethical-Operational Gap**
The ethical commitment to universality exists in constant tension with operational underfunding and political fragmentation. Healthcare is **provincially delivered but federally mandated**, leading to variation and intergovernmental conflict. Chronic issues—**wait times, rural emergency department closures, health worker burnout**—represent a systemic failure to fulfill the *Accessibility* principle.

This has fueled debates over **two-tier healthcare**, proposing a parallel private system for those who can pay. The ethical critique, grounded in the *Canada Health Act*, is that such a system violates *Universality* and *Accessibility* by allowing wealth to purchase faster care, eroding political will to fund the public system and creating a class-based hierarchy in health outcomes. Proponents argue it alleviates public system strain and respects patient choice—a tension between solidarity and liberty unresolved in policy.

#### **3. & 4. The Autonomy Revolution: From Rodriguez to Carter**
The medicare tradition concerns a **right to care**; the MAID debate concerns a **right to be free from imposed care**. These ethics collided in the courts.

In **Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) [1993] 3 SCR 519**, Sue Rodriguez, with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), challenged the Criminal Code prohibition on assisted suicide as a violation of her **Charter Section 7** right to “life, liberty and security of the person.” The Supreme Court, in a **5-4 decision**, upheld the ban. The majority prioritized the state’s interest in **protecting vulnerable persons** from coercion and error. The dissent, led by Justice McLachlin, argued the law was overbroad and infringed on **bodily autonomy** and dignity. Rodriguez died in **1994** with the assistance of an anonymous physician—an act of civil disobedience.

Two decades later, in **Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) [2015] 1 SCR 331**, the Supreme Court **unanimously reversed** *Rodriguez*. The Court found the blanket prohibition on physician-assisted death violated Section 7 for “a competent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life and (2) has a grievous and irremediable medical condition…that causes enduring suffering.” The ethical reasoning marked a shift: autonomy and the relief of suffering for competent adults now outweighed the blanket risk of harm to the vulnerable, which could be managed by a “carefully designed system.”

#### **5. & 6. Legislating MAID: Autonomy, Vulnerability, and the Shadow of Abandonment**
Parliament’s response, **Bill C-14 (2016)**, legalized MAID but restricted it to adults whose natural death was “reasonably foreseeable.” This limitation was immediately criticized by disability scholars like **Catherine Frazee** and legal experts like **Jocelyn Downie** as recreating the *Carter*-identified violation for those with enduring, non-terminal suffering.

**Bill C-7 (2021)**, responding to the *Truchon* Quebec Superior Court decision, removed the “reasonably foreseeable” requirement, creating a two-track system. It also scheduled an expansion of eligibility to persons whose sole underlying condition is a **mental illness**, though this has been **delayed multiple times** and is currently paused until at least 2027 amid profound ethical concerns.

The central **ethical crisis** emerging is the line between **autonomy and abandonment**. Reports from Parliamentary committees, the **Council of Canadians with Disabilities**, and the **UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities (2021)** document cases where individuals, particularly those with disabilities, seek MAID not due to irremediable suffering from illness, but due to a lack of **adequate housing, home care, disability supports, or income**. As disability rights advocates argue, a **“right to die” is meaningless without a concomitant “right to live with dignity.”**

This debate occurs under the **long shadow of eugenics** in Canada, notably **Alberta’s Sexual Sterilization Act (1928-1972)**, which authorized the sterilization of individuals deemed “mentally defective.” The legacy was acknowledged in **Muir v. Alberta [1996] 132 DLR (4th) 695**, where the court found the government liable for failing to protect Leilani Muir. This history informs the vigilance of disability communities regarding MAID, fearing a new, medically-sanctioned pathway for eliminating lives deemed not worth living due to social neglect.

#### **7. The Unfinished Project: Pharmacare**
Canada remains the **only country with a universal healthcare system that does not include universal prescription drug coverage**. This creates the absurd and unethical scenario where the system will pay for a hospital stay for a diabetic coma, but not for the insulin that could prevent it. The **Hoskins Report (2019, “A Prescription for Canada: Achieving Pharmacare for All”)** recommended a single-payer, public pharmacare system, framing it as the logical and ethical completion of the medicare project. The gap between this recommendation and implementation highlights the ongoing political struggle to expand the boundaries of the “medically necessary.”

#### **8. Key Scholarly Contours**
The debate is shaped by scholars who often disagree profoundly:
*   **Jocelyn Downie**: A leading legal scholar advocating for expansive access to MAID as a matter of Charter rights and compassion.
*   **Trudo Lemmens**: A health law and bioethics scholar expressing deep caution about MAID expansion, particularly regarding mental illness and safeguards for vulnerable populations.
*   **Catherine Frazee**: A disability studies scholar and activist articulating the powerful disability rights critique of MAID, linking it to systemic ableism and abandonment.
*   **Colleen Flood**: A health policy and law scholar focused on medicare sustainability, governance, and the legal and ethical implications of privatization.

**Conclusion:** The Canadian healthcare ethics tradition is not a static achievement but a live, often painful, negotiation. It swings between the pole of **collective solidarity** (medicare) and that of **individual autonomy** (MAID). The system’s moral credibility now hinges on its ability to bridge the chasm between these principles—to ensure that the right to choose death is not a product of the state’s failure to provide the means to live. The unfinished work of pharmacare and adequate disability supports are not merely policy gaps; they are ethical failures that test the foundational promise of healthcare as a right of social citizenship.

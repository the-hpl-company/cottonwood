# Canadian Ethical Thought, 1945–2000: The Charter Era and the Crisis of Recognition

The postwar period witnessed the collapse of the old Canadian compact—a bicultural, British-derived, and often implicitly Protestant and colonial order—and its fraught, incomplete replacement by a new ethical framework built on **rights, recognition, and pluralism**. This transformation was driven by Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, the rise of Indigenous and immigrant voices, and a philosophical shift towards liberalism and multiculturalism, culminating in the constitutional patriation of 1982. Yet this new framework was continually contested, revealing Canada’s core ethical tension: the struggle to reconcile a universalist Charter liberalism with deep, particularist claims of nationhood, sovereignty, and historical injustice.

### 1. The Quiet Revolution (1960s) & the Ethics of National Liberation
The **Quiet Revolution** (*Révolution tranquille*) was not merely a political shift but a profound ethical rupture. Quebec moved, in a single generation, from the **clerico-nationalism** of Maurice Duplessis (pre-1960) to a **secular, statist, and modernizing nationalism**. The ethical driver was collective self-determination: ***“Maîtres chez nous”*** (masters in our own house), the 1962 Liberal slogan. This was realized in the **nationalization of Hydro-Québec (1963)** under René Lévesque—a conscious act of economic decolonization, asserting public control over natural resources for collective benefit.

The dark corollary was the **Front de libération du Québec (FLQ)** and the **October Crisis of 1970**. The FLQ’s manifesto denounced Anglo-colonial exploitation and francophone proletarianization. Their kidnapping of British diplomat James Cross and Quebec Minister Pierre Laporte, and Laporte’s subsequent murder, presented the ultimate ethical crisis for the Canadian state. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s invocation of the **War Measures Act** suspended habeas corpus, authorized mass arrests without charge, and deployed the military. When asked how far he would go, Trudeau replied, ***“Just watch me.”*** The ethical justification was **utilitarian-statist**: the preservation of the state and social order justifies the temporary suspension of civil liberties. This moment crystallized the clash between Trudeau’s pan-Canadian liberal individualism and Quebec’s collectivist nationalism—a clash that would define constitutional politics for decades.

### 2. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–1969) & the Limits of “Two Founding Peoples”
The **B&B Commission** was Canada’s most ambitious postwar attempt to define its ethical core. Its central finding was that Canada faced a grave crisis due to Quebec’s alienation and the inequality between English and French. Its solution: **official bilingualism** and the recognition of **“two founding peoples.”** This led to the **Official Languages Act (1969)**, establishing French and English as equal languages of federal government.

The ethical failure was one of **exclusion**. The “two founding peoples” framework rendered **Indigenous nations** invisible, treating them as ethnic minorities rather than sovereign political communities with prior and enduring title. It also marginalized **immigrant “other ethnic groups,”** whose testimony led to **Book IV (1969)** on their contributions, but only as additions to a bicultural core. The Commission asked, ***“What does Canada want to be?”*** The answer it gave was incomplete, setting the stage for the next three decades of conflict over whose Canada this was.

### 3. Multiculturalism as Ethical Policy & Its Philosophical Foundations
In response to the B&B Commission’s limitations, Prime Minister Trudeau announced the **Multiculturalism Policy within a Bilingual Framework (1971)**. It was an ethical bargain: cultural diversity would be celebrated and supported, but within the overarching structure of English-French bilingualism. This was codified in the **Canadian Multiculturalism Act (1988)**.

The philosophical defense came from Canadian scholars. **Charles Taylor’s *“The Politics of Recognition”* (1992)**, based on his Massey Lectures, argued that a liberal society must recognize the **“authenticity”** of cultural identities, as non-recognition imposes a harmful, distorting “misrecognition” on individuals. **Will Kymlicka’s *Multicultural Citizenship* (1995)** provided the liberal-egalitarian justification: certain group-differentiated rights (e.g., for national minorities like Quebecers or Indigenous peoples) are necessary to ensure fairness and freedom.

Critiques emerged immediately. Novelist **Neil Bissoondath’s *Selling Illusions: The Cult of Multiculturalism in Canada* (1994)** attacked the policy as fostering ghettoization and a shallow “song-and-dance” folklore, while ignoring substantive inequality and pressuring assimilation into a “mosaic” mold. The core ethical question persisted: does state-sponsored multiculturalism address **structural racism and economic disparity**, or does it mask them under a celebration of difference?

### 4. The Constitution Act, 1982 & the Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Trudeau’s Ethical Project
Patriation and the **Charter** represent the triumph of **rights-based liberalism** as Canada’s dominant ethical language. Key sections embody distinct ethical commitments:
- **Section 1**: Guarantees rights and freedoms subject only to ***“such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”*** This establishes a **proportionality ethic**—rights are not absolute but must be balanced against collective interests.
- **Section 2**: Protects **fundamental freedoms** (conscience, religion, thought, belief, expression, assembly, association).
- **Section 15(1)**: The equality clause: ***“Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination…”*** This became the tool for challenging systemic discrimination.
- **Section 25**: A **shield clause**, ensuring Charter rights shall not be construed to abrogate or derogate from Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights.
- **Section 27**: Directs Charter interpretation to be ***“consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.”***
- **Section 33**: The **notwithstanding clause**, the quintessential Canadian compromise. It allows Parliament or a legislature to override certain Charter rights for five-year, renewable periods. It embodies the ethical tension between **judicial supremacy** (rights as trumps) and **parliamentary sovereignty** (elected officials as final arbiters).

The ethical rupture was Quebec’s exclusion. The **“Night of the Long Knives”** (November 4–5, 1981) saw the federal government and nine provinces agree to patriation without Quebec Premier René Lévesque. Quebec has never formally assented to the Constitution Act, 1982, rendering it, in Quebec’s view, an **imposed ethical order**.

### 5. Meech Lake (1987–1990) & Charlottetown (1992): The Ethics of Failure
The **Meech Lake Accord** was an attempt to bring Quebec “in with honour” by recognizing it as a **“distinct society”** (Section 2). Its ethical significance lay in its attempt to **amend the 1982 ethical framework** to accommodate Quebec’s collectivist nationalism.

Its failure was orchestrated by two ethical rejections:
1. **Elijah Harper’s Refusal (1990)**: The Cree MLA in Manitoba, holding an eagle feather, refused unanimous consent to bypass procedural rules, killing the Accord. His act was a monumental ethical statement: a constitutional deal among federal and provincial governments that **ignored Indigenous peoples and their right to self-determination** was illegitimate. Harper stated it was “not the right process” for addressing Indigenous rights.
2. **Popular Opposition**: Critics like **Pierre Trudeau** denounced “distinct society” as creating a hierarchy of citizenship and undermining Charter individualism. Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells argued it violated the equality of provinces.

The subsequent **Charlottetown Accord (1992)**, which attempted to address Quebec, Indigenous self-government, Senate reform, and more, was rejected in a national referendum. The failures revealed a fundamental ethical impasse: Canada could not reconcile **Quebec’s national affirmation, Indigenous self-determination, and a pan-Canadian Charter citizenship** within a single constitutional formula.

### 6. Supreme Court Decisions as Ethical Reasoning
The Supreme Court became the primary arbiter of the new ethical order, applying Charter principles to contentious social issues.

- ***R. v. Oakes* (1986)**: Established the **proportionality test** for Section 1 limitations. Any law limiting a Charter right must have a **pressing and substantial objective**, be **rationally connected**, **minimally impair** the right, and have **proportional effects**. This is the operational heart of Canadian rights ethics.
- ***R. v. Morgentaler* (1988)**: Struck down Canada’s abortion law (Criminal Code s. 251) for violating **Section 7** security of the person. The Court found the procedural hurdles caused **“psychological trauma”** and **“physical danger,”** prioritizing **individual bodily autonomy** over state morality.
- ***R. v. Sparrow* (1990)**: The first major post-1982 Aboriginal rights case. Recognized **Section 35(1)** rights as not absolute but subject to **“justifiable infringement”** by the Crown, which must demonstrate a **“compelling and substantial”** legislative objective and uphold a **fiduciary duty**. Established the **“honour of the Crown”** as a governing ethical principle.
- ***Delgamuukw v. British Columbia* (1997)**: Recognized **Aboriginal title** as a right to the land itself. Crucially, it accepted **oral history** as admissible evidence, challenging Western legal epistemology and validating Indigenous ways of knowing—an ethical shift in the courtroom.
- ***Vriend v. Alberta* (1998)**: Found that Alberta’s omission of sexual orientation from its human rights code violated **Section 15** equality rights. The Court **“read in”** the protection, asserting that Charter values require the state to protect vulnerable minorities from discrimination, even by omission.

### 7. Key Scholars: Articulating the Canadian Ethical Dilemma
- **Charles Taylor**: Explored the tension between **liberal neutrality** and **communal recognition**, arguing for a “deep diversity” that could accommodate Quebec as a distinct societal culture.
- **Will Kymlicka**: Systematically distinguished between **“multinational”** (Quebec, Indigenous nations) and **“polyethnic”** (immigrant groups) claims to rights, providing a liberal theoretical framework for Canada’s asymmetry.
- **James Tully**: In ***Strange Multiplicity* (1995)**, argued for a **“constitutional dialogue”** and a **“treaty federalism”** that respects the continuity of Indigenous sovereignty and the historical reality of **“treaty constitutionalism.”**
- **Peter Russell**: The preeminent scholar of Canadian constitutional politics, whose work (e.g., ***Constitutional Odyssey*, 1992**) emphasized the **pragmatic, incremental, and often failed** nature of Canada’s ethical negotiations, warning against grand, abstract solutions.

### Conclusion: The Unresolved Ethical Landscape
By 2000, Canada’s ethical thought had settled into a **rights-based, multicultural, and judicially-centric model**, but its foundations were unstable. The **Quebec question** remained open, the **Indigenous claim to sovereignty** was powerfully reasserted through court victories and blockades, and **multiculturalism** faced accusations of being a gloss on enduring inequality. The Charter era’s great ethical promise—a common citizenship of equal individuals—was perpetually challenged by the older, deeper realities of **national pluralism and colonial inheritance**. The Canadian ethical tradition, as scholar **John Ralston Saul** observed, became the ongoing, often agonizing, attempt to negotiate this “triangle” of Quebec, Indigenous peoples, and the rest of Canada within a framework that could never quite contain them.

### **Canadian Ethical Thought, 1945–2000: From Postwar Consensus to the Charter Era**

The postwar period to the end of the 20th century was a time of profound ethical redefinition in Canada. The country grappled with decolonization, secularization, constitutional patriation, and the tension between unity and diversity. This era saw the collapse of old hierarchies (Catholic Quebec, Anglo-Protestant dominance, Indigenous subjugation) and the rise of new ethical frameworks—multiculturalism, Charter rights, Indigenous resurgence—each carrying its own contradictions. Below, we trace these transformations through key moments, documents, and thinkers.

## **1. The Quiet Revolution (1960s): Quebec’s Ethical Upheaval**
### **From *La survivance* to *Maîtres chez nous***
Before the 1960s, Quebec’s ethical order was defined by **Catholic ultramontanism**, a fusion of faith, language, and conservative nationalism. The **Duplessis era (1936–1939, 1944–1959)** reinforced this order: the Church controlled education, healthcare, and social services, while the provincial government resisted federal encroachment under the banner of **"provincial autonomy."** The **Asbestos Strike (1949)**, where miners challenged both the Church and the state, was an early crack in this system.

The **Quiet Revolution (Révolution tranquille, 1960–1966)** shattered it. Under **Jean Lesage’s Liberal government (1960–1966)**, Quebec underwent **rapid secularization, state expansion, and nationalist mobilization**. Key ethical shifts:
- **Nationalization of Hydro-Québec (1963):** The state took control of electricity, symbolizing Quebec’s rejection of Anglo-Canadian economic dominance. The slogan **"Maîtres chez nous" (Masters in our own house)** encapsulated the new ethic: Quebec would no longer be a dominated minority but a modern, self-determining society.
- **Education reform:** The **Parent Commission (1961–1966)** secularized schools, removing Church control. The **Ministry of Education (1964)** centralized authority, ending centuries of clerical dominance.
- **Language as identity:** The **Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Position of the French Language (Gendron Commission, 1968–1973)** laid the groundwork for **Bill 101 (1977)**, which made French the official language of Quebec. Language was no longer just a cultural marker but a **political and ethical claim to survival**.

### **The October Crisis (1970): Ethics of State Violence vs. Revolutionary Violence**
The **Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ)**, a Marxist-Leninist group, escalated its campaign for Quebec independence through bombings and kidnappings. In October 1970, they abducted **British diplomat James Cross** and **Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte**, whom they later murdered.

Prime Minister **Pierre Trudeau** invoked the **War Measures Act (1914)**, suspending civil liberties and deploying the military. Over **450 people were arrested without charge**. Trudeau’s famous **"Just watch me"** interview (October 13, 1970) framed the crisis as a **moral choice between order and chaos**:
> *"There’s a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don’t like to see people with helmets and guns. All I can say is, go on and bleed, but it’s more important to keep law and order in this society than to be worried about weak-kneed people who don’t like the looks of an army."*

**Ethical questions:**
- Was the suspension of civil liberties justified to preserve the state?
- Was the FLQ’s violence a legitimate response to colonial oppression, or a terrorist threat?
- Did Trudeau’s actions reinforce Quebec’s sense of alienation from Canada?

The crisis exposed the **fragility of Canada’s ethical consensus**: Quebec’s nationalist movement was not just political but **moral**, demanding recognition of its distinct society. The federal response, meanwhile, revealed a **liberal state willing to use illiberal means** to maintain unity.

## **2. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–1969): Whose Canada?**
### **The Two Founding Peoples Myth**
In response to Quebec’s rising nationalism, **Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson** established the **Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–1969)**, co-chaired by **André Laurendeau (Quebec nationalist) and Davidson Dunton (Anglo-Canadian)**. Its mandate was to investigate **"the existing state of bilingualism and biculturalism in Canada"** and recommend ways to **"develop the Canadian Confederation on the basis of an equal partnership between the two founding races."**

The **1969 Official Languages Act** implemented its key recommendation: **English and French became Canada’s official languages**, with federal services required to be available in both.

### **Ethical Exclusions: Indigenous Peoples and Immigrants**
The Commission’s **"two founding peoples"** framework was **ethically flawed**:
- It **erased Indigenous nations**, who had their own legal and ethical systems long before European contact (e.g., the **Two Row Wampum / Guswenta (1613)**, the **Royal Proclamation of 1763**, and **Numbered Treaties**).
- It **marginalized non-British, non-French immigrants**, despite their growing numbers (e.g., Ukrainian, Italian, and Chinese Canadians, who had faced **racial exclusion laws** like the **Chinese Immigration Act (1923)** and **Japanese internment (1942–1949)**).

**Indigenous pushback:**
- The **National Indian Brotherhood (1968)** and **Harold Cardinal’s *The Unjust Society* (1969)** condemned the Commission for ignoring Indigenous rights.
- **George Manuel (Secwepemc leader)** argued that Canada was not a "bicultural" but a **multinational state**, with Indigenous nations as **equal partners**, not minorities.

The Commission’s legacy was **both progressive and exclusionary**: it enshrined bilingualism but **reinforced a colonial narrative** that sidelined Indigenous and immigrant voices.

## **3. Multiculturalism as Ethical Policy (1971–1988)**
### **From Biculturalism to Multiculturalism**
In 1971, **Pierre Trudeau** announced Canada’s **Multiculturalism Policy**, declaring:
> *"Although there are two official languages, there is no official culture, nor does any ethnic group take precedence over any other."*

This was a **radical ethical shift**: Canada would no longer define itself as a **bicultural** (English-French) nation but as a **multicultural mosaic**. The **1988 Canadian Multiculturalism Act** formalized this, stating that multiculturalism was a **"fundamental characteristic of Canadian society."**

### **Philosophical Defenses: Taylor and Kymlicka**
Two Canadian philosophers provided the **most influential ethical justifications** for multiculturalism:
1. **Charles Taylor (*The Politics of Recognition*, 1992)**
   - Argued that **recognition of cultural identity** was a **moral necessity**, not just a policy choice.
   - Distinguished between **"equal dignity" (liberal universalism)** and **"difference recognition" (cultural particularism)**.
   - Influenced **Quebec’s language laws** (e.g., **Bill 101**) and **Indigenous land claims**.

2. **Will Kymlicka (*Multicultural Citizenship*, 1995)**
   - Developed a **liberal theory of minority rights**, arguing that **group-differentiated rights** (e.g., Indigenous self-government, Quebec’s language laws) were compatible with liberal democracy.
   - Distinguished between:
     - **National minorities** (Quebec, Indigenous nations) → **self-government rights**
     - **Immigrant groups** → **polyethnic rights** (e.g., religious accommodations)
     - **Isolated minorities** (e.g., the Doukhobors) → **special representation rights**

### **Critiques: Does Multiculturalism Mask Inequality?**
Not all accepted multiculturalism as an ethical good:
- **Neil Bissoondath (*Selling Illusions: The Cult of Multiculturalism in Canada*, 1994)**
  - Argued that multiculturalism **commodified culture**, turning diversity into a **marketable brand** while ignoring **racism and economic inequality**.
  - Example: The **1986 Employment Equity Act** was weak, and **systemic racism** persisted (e.g., **police carding of Black Canadians**, **underrepresentation of Indigenous people in universities**).
- **Indigenous critics (e.g., Taiaiake Alfred, *Peace, Power, Righteousness*, 1999)**
  - Multiculturalism treated Indigenous peoples as **one "culture" among many**, ignoring their **sovereign nationhood**.
  - The **1969 White Paper** (which proposed abolishing the **Indian Act** without Indigenous consent) had shown that **assimilationist policies** could be repackaged as "inclusion."

**Ethical tension:**
Multiculturalism was **both a recognition of diversity and a tool of state control**. It celebrated difference but **did not challenge the colonial structures** that produced inequality.

## **4. The Constitution Act (1982) and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms**
### **Trudeau’s Ethical Project: A Just Society**
Pierre Trudeau’s **patriation of the Constitution (1982)** and the **Charter of Rights and Freedoms** were the **culmination of his liberal vision**: a Canada where **individual rights** would protect citizens from **majoritarian oppression** (e.g., Quebec’s language laws, provincial discrimination).

Key Charter sections:
- **Section 1 (Reasonable Limits Clause):** Rights are **"subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."** (This was later defined in **R. v. Oakes, 1986**.)
- **Section 2 (Fundamental Freedoms):** Conscience, religion, thought, expression, assembly, association.
- **Section 15 (Equality Rights):** **"Every individual is equal before and under the law"** (enumerated grounds: race, sex, disability, etc.).
- **Section 25:** **"The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada."**
- **Section 27:** **"This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians."**
- **Section 33 (Notwithstanding Clause):** Allows governments to **override Charter rights** for five-year renewable periods.

### **The Night of the Long Knives (1981): Quebec’s Betrayal**
Quebec **never signed the Constitution Act (1982)**. In November 1981, **nine provinces and the federal government** reached a deal **without Quebec’s consent**—a moment Quebec nationalists called **"La nuit des longs couteaux" (The Night of the Long Knives)**.

**Ethical implications:**
- The Charter was **imposed on Quebec**, reinforcing its sense of **alienation from Canada**.
- Quebec’s **distinct society** was **not recognized** in the Constitution, setting the stage for future conflicts.

### **The Notwithstanding Clause: Ethical Compromise or Democratic Weakness?**
The **notwithstanding clause (Section 33)** was a **uniquely Canadian compromise** between **judicial supremacy** and **parliamentary sovereignty**. It allowed governments to **override Charter rights** (except democratic, mobility, and language rights).

**Controversies:**
- **Quebec’s use of Section 33 (1988):** After the Supreme Court struck down parts of **Bill 101** in **Ford v. Quebec (1988)**, Quebec re-enacted the law using the notwithstanding clause.
- **Ontario’s threatened use (2018):** Doug Ford’s government considered using it to override a court ruling on **Toronto’s ward boundaries**.

**Ethical debate:**
- **Pro:** Protects democracy from **unelected judges**.
- **Con:** Allows governments to **violate fundamental rights** (e.g., **Saskatchewan’s 1986 use to override gay rights**).

## **5. Meech Lake and Charlottetown: The Ethics of Recognition and Rejection**
### **Meech Lake Accord (1987–1990): Quebec’s "Distinct Society"**
Prime Minister **Brian Mulroney** sought to **bring Quebec into the constitutional fold** with the **Meech Lake Accord (1987)**, which recognized Quebec as a **"distinct society"** and gave provinces more power.

**Ethical problem:** It **ignored Indigenous peoples**. **Elijah Harper (Cree MLA in Manitoba)** famously **blocked ratification in 1990** by refusing to give unanimous consent, declaring:
> *"I cannot, in all conscience, support a constitutional amendment that will once again deny Aboriginal peoples the right to be full participants in the constitutional process."*

Harper’s stand was a **defining ethical moment**: an Indigenous leader **using parliamentary procedure to assert nationhood** in the face of a deal that treated Indigenous peoples as **afterthoughts**.

### **Charlottetown Accord (1992): Too Much, Too Late**
The **Charlottetown Accord (1992)** attempted a **grand bargain**:
- **Quebec as a distinct society**
- **Indigenous self-government**
- **Senate reform**
- **A social charter**

It was **defeated in a national referendum (54% No)**. **Ethical reasons for rejection:**
- **Quebec nationalists** (e.g., **Lucien Bouchard**) saw it as **not enough**.
- **Western Canadians** (e.g., **Preston Manning’s Reform Party**) saw it as **too much centralization**.
- **Indigenous leaders** (e.g., **Ovide Mercredi**) argued it **did not go far enough** on self-government.

**Legacy:** The failures of Meech and Charlottetown showed that **Canada’s ethical consensus was fractured**. The country could not agree on **what kind of nation it wanted to be**.

## **6. Key Supreme Court Decisions as Ethical Reasoning**
The **Charter era** saw the Supreme Court become a **moral arbiter**, defining Canada’s ethical commitments through landmark rulings.

| **Case** | **Year** | **Ethical Issue** | **Ruling & Significance** |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **R. v. Oakes** | 1986 | **Proportionality in rights restrictions** | Established the **Oakes Test**: Rights can only be limited if the law has a **pressing objective**, is **rationally connected** to it, **minimally impairs** the right, and has **proportional effects**. |
| **R. v. Morgentaler** | 1988 | **Abortion rights** | Struck down Canada’s abortion law (**Section 251 of the Criminal Code**) as a violation of **Section 7 (security of the person)**. |
| **R. v. Sparrow** | 1990 | **Aboriginal fishing rights** | Ruled that **Section 35 of the Constitution Act (1982)** protected **existing Indigenous rights** and that governments could only infringe them for a **valid legislative objective** (e.g., conservation). |
| **Delgamuukw v. British Columbia** | 1997 | **Aboriginal title & oral history** | Recognized **Aboriginal title** as a **sui generis right** and allowed **oral history** as evidence in court. |
| **Vriend v. Alberta** | 1998 | **LGBTQ+ rights** | Read **sexual orientation** into Alberta’s **Individual Rights Protection Act**, even though it was not explicitly listed. |

**Ethical themes in these rulings:**
- **Balancing individual rights vs. collective goods** (Oakes, Morgentaler).
- **Recognizing Indigenous legal traditions** (Sparrow, Delgamuukw).
- **Expanding equality rights** (Vriend).

## **7. Key Scholars: Theorizing Canada’s Ethical Dilemmas**
| **Scholar** | **Key Work** | **Ethical Contribution** |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Charles Taylor** | *The Politics of Recognition* (1992) | Argued that **cultural recognition** was a **moral necessity**, not just a policy choice. Influenced **multiculturalism** and **Quebec’s language laws**. |
| **Will Kymlicka** | *Multicultural Citizenship* (1995) | Developed a **liberal theory of minority rights**, distinguishing between **national minorities (Quebec, Indigenous nations)** and **immigrant groups**. |
| **James Tully** | *Strange Multiplicity* (1995) | Critiqued **Western constitutionalism** for imposing **uniformity** on **diverse Indigenous legal traditions**. Advocated for **treaty federalism**. |
| **Peter Russell** | *Constitutional Odyssey* (1992) | Analyzed Canada’s **constitutional struggles** as a **clash between different visions of justice** (e.g., **Quebec’s distinct society vs. Trudeau’s individual rights**). |

## **Conclusion: The Ethical Gaps of the Charter Era**
The postwar to Charter era (1945–2000) was a time of **radical ethical redefinition** in Canada:
- **Quebec** transformed from a **Catholic traditionalist society** to a **secular, nationalist one**, demanding **recognition as a distinct society**.
- **Multiculturalism** replaced **biculturalism**, but **structural inequalities** (racism, Indigenous dispossession) persisted.
- The **Charter of Rights** enshrined **individual freedoms**, but **Quebec never signed it**, and **Indigenous nations were sidelined**.
- The **Supreme Court** became a **moral authority**, but **parliamentary sovereignty** (via the notwithstanding clause) remained a **check on judicial power**.
- **Indigenous resurgence** (e.g., **Elijah Harper, Del

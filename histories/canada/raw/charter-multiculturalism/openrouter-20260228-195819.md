### **Postwar Canadian Ethical Thought: From the Quiet Revolution to the Charter Era (1945-2000)**  

#### **1. The Quiet Revolution (1960s) – Quebec’s Ethical Rupture**  
The **Quiet Revolution** (1960–66) marked Quebec’s rapid secularization and rejection of Catholic traditionalism under Premier Jean Lesage’s Liberal government. The slogan *"Maîtres chez nous"* ("Masters in our own house") captured the shift from clerical authority to state-led modernization.  

- **Hydro-Québec nationalization (1962)** – Symbolized economic sovereignty, wresting control from Anglo-Canadian capital. Ethical justification: public ownership as democratic stewardship.  
- **October Crisis (1970)** – The FLQ’s kidnapping of James Cross and murder of Pierre Laporte led to **Trudeau invoking the War Measures Act** (suspending habeas corpus). His defiant *"Just watch me"* framed state violence as necessary to preserve liberal democracy. Critics (e.g., René Lévesque) saw it as authoritarian overreach.  

#### **2. Bilingualism & Biculturalism (1963–1969) – Whose Canada?**  
The **Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism** (Laurendeau-Dunton Commission) sought to reconcile French/English tensions but excluded Indigenous and immigrant voices.  

- **Official Languages Act (1969)** – Institutionalized bilingualism (French/English equality in federal institutions). Ethical flaw: **"Two founding nations"** erased Indigenous sovereignty (e.g., **Treaty of Niagara, 1764**) and immigrant contributions.  

#### **3. Multiculturalism as Ethical Policy (1971–1995)**  
Trudeau’s **1971 Multicultural Policy** (later **1988 Multiculturalism Act**) framed diversity as a national virtue—but within a bilingual framework.  

- **Charles Taylor’s *The Politics of Recognition* (1992)** – Argued identity is dialogical; denying recognition is a form of harm.  
- **Will Kymlicka’s *Multicultural Citizenship* (1995)** – Defended group-differentiated rights (e.g., Indigenous self-government).  
- **Critiques**:  
  - **Neil Bissoondath (*Selling Illusions*, 1994)** – Multiculturalism as superficial "ethnic pageantry" masking systemic racism.  
  - **Glen Coulthard (*Red Skin, White Masks*, 2014)** – Liberal recognition fails to address Indigenous dispossession.  

#### **4. Constitution Act (1982) & Charter of Rights – Trudeau’s Ethical Project**  
The **Charter of Rights and Freedoms** entrenched individual rights but balanced them with collective limits:  

- **Section 1** – Rights subject to *"reasonable limits."*  
- **Section 15** – Equality rights (later expanded in *Vriend v. Alberta*, 1998, to include sexual orientation).  
- **Section 25** – Aboriginal rights preserved.  
- **Section 27** – Multicultural heritage as interpretive principle.  
- **Section 33 (Notwithstanding Clause)** – Allowed legislatures to override certain rights (used controversially by Quebec on language laws).  

Quebec refused to sign (**"Night of the Long Knives," 1981**), seeing it as imposed federalism.  

#### **5. Meech Lake (1987) & Charlottetown (1992) – Constitutional Failures**  
Attempts to reconcile Quebec via **"distinct society" clause** failed:  

- **Elijah Harper’s 1990 veto** – The Cree MLA blocked Meech Lake, protesting Indigenous exclusion. A watershed ethical moment: Indigenous refusal of settler constitutionalism.  
- **Charlottetown Accord (1992)** – Rejected in a referendum, exposing fractures in Canada’s ethical self-conception.  

#### **6. Supreme Court as Ethical Arbiter**  
Key rulings shaped Canadian ethics:  

- **R. v. Oakes (1986)** – Established the **proportionality test** for limiting rights.  
- **R. v. Morgentaler (1988)** – Struck down abortion restrictions as violating **Section 7** (security of person).  
- **R. v. Sparrow (1990)** – Upheld Indigenous fishing rights under **Section 35**.  
- **Delgamuukw v. BC (1997)** – Recognized oral history as legal evidence, affirming Indigenous legal traditions.  

#### **7. Key Scholars – Competing Visions**  
- **Charles Taylor** – Communitarian pluralism.  
- **Will Kymlicka** – Liberal multiculturalism.  
- **James Tully (*Strange Multiplicity*, 1995)** – Argued for **treaty federalism** over unitary constitutionalism.  
- **Peter Russell (*Constitutional Odyssey*, 2004)** – Chronicled Canada’s unresolved constitutional ethics.  

### **Conclusion: The Charter Era’s Ethical Contradictions**  
Postwar Canada oscillated between **liberal universalism (Charter rights) and pluralist recognition (multiculturalism, Indigenous sovereignty)**. The failures of Meech/Charlottetown and the rise of **Idle No More (2012)** later exposed the limits of this framework—**Canada’s ethics remain contested between individual rights, collective identities, and unresolved colonial harm.**

This era’s legacy: **Canada’s ethics are defined not by resolution, but by the tension between its ideals and its exclusions.**

### **The Sixties Scoop: A Distinct Ethical Catastrophe in Canadian Colonial Policy**

The **Sixties Scoop** (1951–1980s) was a state-sanctioned system of mass Indigenous child apprehension, distinct from but deeply connected to the **residential school system**. While residential schools operated as federally run institutions, the Sixties Scoop was executed through **provincial child welfare agencies**, which removed an estimated **20,000 Indigenous children** from their families and placed them in non-Indigenous foster and adoptive homes—often without consent or even notification. This policy was not merely a bureaucratic failure but a **deliberate extension of assimilationist logic**, repackaged under the guise of "child protection."

### **1. The Mechanism: Provincial Child Welfare as a Tool of Assimilation**
The Sixties Scoop was enabled by **legal and administrative shifts** that transferred jurisdiction over Indigenous child welfare from the federal government to the provinces. Key developments included:

- **1951 Amendments to the *Indian Act*** (Section 88) – Allowed provincial laws to apply to Indigenous peoples on reserve, including child welfare legislation. This created a **jurisdictional loophole** where provinces could intervene in Indigenous families without federal oversight.
- **1960s–1980s: Mass Apprehensions** – Provincial social workers, often with little to no cultural training, removed children under the pretext of "neglect," a term that was **culturally and economically loaded**. Poverty—itself a product of colonial displacement, reserve underfunding, and systemic racism—was treated as evidence of parental failure.
- **Geographic Scope** – While the Scoop occurred in every province, **Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario** had the highest removal rates. In Manitoba, Indigenous children made up **over 60% of the foster care population** by the 1970s, despite being only **5% of the child population** (*Manitoba Justice Inquiry*, 1991).

The term **"Sixties Scoop"** was coined by **Patrick Johnston** in his 1983 report *Native Children and the Child Welfare System*, which exposed the systemic nature of these removals.

### **2. The Connection to Residential Schools: A Continuity of Intent**
The Sixties Scoop was not an accidental policy but a **direct successor to residential schools**, emerging as those institutions began closing in the 1960s. Key continuities include:

- **Assimilationist Logic** – Both systems sought to **erase Indigenous identity** by severing children from their families, languages, and cultures. As Johnston (1983) noted, the Scoop was **"cultural genocide by other means."**
- **Federal-Provincial Collusion** – The **1965 Canada-Ontario Welfare Services Agreement** and similar deals in other provinces **formalized the transfer of Indigenous child welfare to provincial agencies**, ensuring that assimilation continued even as residential schools were phased out.
- **Cultural Disruption** – While residential schools were overtly coercive, the Scoop was framed as "benevolent" adoption. Yet, as **Raven Sinclair (2007)** argues in *"Identity Lost and Found,"* the psychological damage was comparable: **loss of language, kinship ties, and legal status** (many adoptees lost their *Indian Act* status).

The **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC, 2015)** explicitly linked the two systems, stating:
> *"The Sixties Scoop was a continuation of the assimilation policies that underpinned the residential school system."* (TRC Final Report, Vol. 5, p. 135)

### **3. The Ethical Framework: "Best Interests" as a Colonial Construct**
The Sixties Scoop was justified under the **child welfare principle of "the best interests of the child,"** but this standard was **deeply culturally biased**:

- **Poverty as Neglect** – Social workers routinely conflated **structural poverty** (caused by colonial land dispossession and underfunding) with **parental unfitness**. As **Suzanne Fournier and Ernie Crey** document in *Stolen From Our Embrace* (1997), Indigenous families were **10 times more likely to be investigated for neglect** than non-Indigenous families.
- **Cultural Incompetence** – Social workers, overwhelmingly non-Indigenous, applied **Eurocentric standards of parenting** (e.g., nuclear family structures, material wealth) to Indigenous communities, where **extended kinship networks and communal child-rearing** were the norm.
- **Lack of Consent** – Many parents were **never informed** of their rights or the whereabouts of their children. Some were told their children were being taken **temporarily**, only to discover years later that they had been **adopted out of province or overseas**.

The **Manitoba Justice Inquiry (1991)** found that the child welfare system was **"a new form of residential school"**—one that operated under the **false pretense of protection** while perpetuating cultural destruction.

---

### **4. Transracial Adoption and Cultural Erasure**
The most devastating aspect of the Sixties Scoop was the **permanent severing of children from their communities**:

- **Adoption into White Families** – An estimated **70% of Scoop children** were placed in non-Indigenous homes, often in the **U.S., Europe, or New Zealand**. Some were **illegally trafficked** through adoption agencies.
- **Loss of Status** – Under the *Indian Act*, children adopted by non-Indigenous parents **lost their legal status**, cutting them off from their communities, treaty rights, and cultural identity.
- **Psychological Trauma** – Survivors report **identity confusion, depression, and intergenerational trauma**. Studies show that Scoop survivors have **higher rates of suicide, addiction, and incarceration** than their peers (*Sinclair, 2007*).
- **Language and Culture Loss** – Many adoptees grew up **not knowing they were Indigenous**, only discovering their heritage later in life—if at all.

As **Cindy Blackstock** (Gitxsan scholar and executive director of the **First Nations Child and Family Caring Society**) argues, the Scoop was not just about **individual harm** but about **systemic cultural genocide**:
> *"The goal was to break the transmission of culture, language, and identity from one generation to the next."* (Blackstock, 2016)

### **5. Legal Reckoning: Brown v. Canada and the Limits of Justice**
The Sixties Scoop has seen **partial legal accountability**, but justice remains **incomplete**:

- **Brown v. Canada (2017)** – The **Ontario Superior Court** ruled that the federal government **breached its fiduciary duty** by failing to protect Indigenous children from the harms of the Scoop. The court awarded **$800 million in damages** to survivors, though individual payouts were **capped at $50,000**—far less than the **$400,000+** awarded to residential school survivors.
- **Manitoba’s Apology (2015)** – Premier Greg Selinger issued a **formal apology**, acknowledging that the province **"failed to protect the best interests of Indigenous children."** However, as **Raven Sinclair** notes, apologies without **structural change** are **hollow gestures**.
- **National Sixties Scoop Healing Foundation** – Established in 2019, the foundation provides **mental health support and cultural reclamation programs**, but its funding ($50 million) is **a fraction of what is needed**.

**Critiques of the Settlement:**
- **Insufficient Compensation** – Many survivors argue that **$50,000 is inadequate** for a lifetime of trauma.
- **Exclusion of Métis and Non-Status Survivors** – The settlement **only covered First Nations and Inuit children**, leaving Métis and non-status survivors **without recourse**.
- **No Admission of Genocide** – Unlike the TRC, which labeled residential schools **cultural genocide**, the Sixties Scoop settlements **avoided this terminology**, despite the **intentional destruction of Indigenous families**.

### **6. The Ongoing Crisis: Child Welfare as a Colonial Pipeline**
The Sixties Scoop did not end in the 1980s—it **evolved into the current child welfare crisis**, where Indigenous children remain **overrepresented in foster care at rates higher than during the Scoop**:

- **Disproportionate Apprehensions** – Indigenous children make up **7% of Canada’s child population** but **over 52% of children in foster care** (*Statistics Canada, 2021*).
- **First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v. Canada (2016)** – The **Canadian Human Rights Tribunal** ruled that Canada **wilfully and recklessly discriminated** against First Nations children by **underfunding on-reserve child welfare services**. The tribunal ordered **$40,000 in compensation per affected child**, but the federal government **fought the ruling in court for years**.
- **Jordan’s Principle** – Named after **Jordan River Anderson** (a Cree child who died in hospital in 2005 while governments argued over payment for his home care), this principle mandates that **First Nations children receive necessary services without delay**. However, **implementation remains inconsistent**.
- **Bill C-92 (2019)** – The **Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis Children, Youth and Families** affirms Indigenous jurisdiction over child welfare, but **funding disputes and provincial resistance** have limited its impact.

**Cindy Blackstock** has been a leading voice in exposing this **continuing injustice**:
> *"Canada is still scooping Indigenous children, just in a different way. The system is designed to take kids, not to keep families together."* (Blackstock, 2020)

### **7. Key Scholars and Their Contributions**
The Sixties Scoop has been extensively documented by Indigenous scholars, survivors, and allies:

| **Scholar/Work** | **Key Contribution** |
|------------------|----------------------|

| **Suzanne Fournier & Ernie Crey (1997)** – *Stolen From Our Embrace* | Survivor testimonies; linked the Scoop to **ongoing child welfare crises**. |
| **Cindy Blackstock** – First Nations Child and Family Caring Society | Led legal challenges (*2016 CHRT ruling*); advocates for **Indigenous-led child welfare**. |
| **TRC Final Report (2015)** | Explicitly connected the Scoop to **residential schools and cultural genocide**. |

### **Conclusion: A System That Never Ended**
The Sixties Scoop was not an **aberration** but a **logical extension of Canadian colonial policy**—one that **replaced overt coercion with bureaucratic violence**. While legal settlements and apologies have provided **some measure of recognition**, the **underlying structures of child welfare remain unchanged**. Indigenous children are still **scooped at alarming rates**, and Indigenous families are still **fighting for the right to raise their own children**.

As **Raven Sinclair** writes:
> *"The Sixties Scoop was not a mistake. It was a policy. And until Canada reckons with that, the scooping will continue."* (Sinclair, 2007)

The question remains: **Can Canada dismantle a system designed to destroy Indigenous families, or will it continue to reproduce the same harms under new names?**

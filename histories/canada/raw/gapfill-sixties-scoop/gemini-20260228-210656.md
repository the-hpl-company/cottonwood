Okay, here is an entry on the Sixties Scoop, framed as an ethical catastrophe distinct from but connected to the residential school system, suitable for inclusion in a reference work on harm, care, and stewardship.

### The Sixties Scoop: A Second Wave of Cultural Genocide

The term "Sixties Scoop" refers to the mass removal of Indigenous children from their families and communities, primarily between the 1960s and the 1980s, and their subsequent placement in non-Indigenous foster and adoptive homes. While distinct from the residential school system, it represents a continuation of assimilationist policies that have caused profound and lasting harm to Indigenous peoples in Canada. The Sixties Scoop exemplifies a failure of care and stewardship, driven by systemic racism and a disregard for Indigenous cultures and rights.

**1. The Mechanism of Removal:**

Provincial child welfare agencies were the primary actors in the Sixties Scoop. Fueled by a belief that Indigenous families were inherently unfit, social workers apprehended children based on often-dubious criteria, such as poverty or lack of housing, which were themselves consequences of colonial policies. An estimated 20,000 children were removed during this period, with Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario experiencing particularly high rates of apprehension (Sinclair, 2007). This mass removal was facilitated by amendments to provincial child welfare legislation that made it easier to apprehend children deemed to be "in need of protection" (Fournier & Crey, 1997).

**2. Continuity with Residential Schools:**

As the residential school system began to decline in the 1960s, child welfare emerged as a new tool for assimilation. Patrick Johnston's 1983 report, *Native Children and the Child Welfare System*, is credited with coining the term "Sixties Scoop" and highlighted the systemic bias within child welfare. The underlying intent remained the same: to sever Indigenous children from their families, cultures, and languages, thereby eroding Indigenous identity and undermining Indigenous communities. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) recognized the Sixties Scoop as a form of cultural genocide, noting its devastating impact on Indigenous families and the intergenerational trauma it caused (TRC, 2015). The TRC makes clear the ongoing nature of this harm in Call to Action #4: "We call upon the federal government to enact Aboriginal child-welfare legislation that establishes national standards for Aboriginal child apprehension and custody cases."

**3. The Ethical Framework of Child Welfare:**

The Sixties Scoop was rooted in a flawed ethical framework that pathologized Indigenous families and communities. Social workers, often lacking cultural competence, applied culturally biased standards to assess parental fitness. Poverty, inadequate housing, and lack of access to resources – all direct consequences of colonial policies – were used as evidence of neglect, justifying the removal of children. The "best interests of the child" standard, enshrined in child welfare legislation, was interpreted through a Eurocentric lens, prioritizing assimilation over cultural preservation (Blackstock, 2011). As Cindy Blackstock argues, the very concept of "best interests" becomes a tool of oppression when applied without regard to cultural context and Indigenous rights. This bias is still felt; Section 12 of the *Canadian Human Rights Act* covers discriminatory practices.

**4. Transracial Adoption and Loss of Identity:**

A significant number of children apprehended during the Sixties Scoop were placed in transracial adoptions, often with white families in the United States or overseas. This practice resulted in a profound loss of language, culture, and identity for adoptees. Many lost their legal status as Indigenous persons under the *Indian Act*, further severing their ties to their communities. The psychological impact on survivors has been devastating, with many experiencing identity confusion, cultural dislocation, and higher rates of suicide, addiction, and mental health issues (Sinclair, 2007). The erasure of Indigenous identity through transracial adoption represents a profound ethical failure, denying individuals their fundamental right to cultural belonging.

**5. Legal Reckoning and Limited Justice:**

In *Brown v. Canada* (2017), the Ontario Superior Court ruled that the federal government was liable for the harm caused by the Sixties Scoop in Ontario. The court found that the government had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the loss of Indigenous identity among children placed in non-Indigenous homes. An $800 million settlement was reached, providing compensation to survivors and establishing the National Sixties Scoop Healing Foundation. While these settlements and apologies, such as Manitoba's in 2015, acknowledge the harm caused, they are often seen as insufficient to address the deep and lasting trauma experienced by survivors and their communities. True justice requires not only financial compensation but also systemic changes to prevent future harm.

**6. The Ongoing Crisis and Systemic Discrimination:**

Despite the legal reckoning, Indigenous children continue to be overrepresented in the child welfare system. While Indigenous children make up approximately 7% of the child population in Canada, they account for over 50% of children in foster care (Blackstock, 2011). This disparity highlights the persistence of systemic discrimination within child welfare. Cindy Blackstock and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society have been at the forefront of advocating for equitable funding and culturally appropriate services for Indigenous children. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled in 2016 that the Canadian government discriminated against First Nations children by underfunding child welfare services on reserves, violating Section 5 of the *Canadian Human Rights Act*. Jordan's Principle, named after Jordan River Anderson, a First Nations child who died in hospital while the federal and provincial governments argued over who would pay for his home care, aims to ensure that First Nations children have equal access to government services. The ongoing overrepresentation of Indigenous children in care demonstrates that the Sixties Scoop is not just a historical event but a continuing crisis that demands urgent action.

**7. Conclusion:**

The Sixties Scoop represents a dark chapter in Canadian history, characterized by the systematic removal of Indigenous children from their families and cultures. While apologies and settlements offer a measure of acknowledgment, they do not fully address the deep and lasting harm caused by this policy. Achieving true justice requires a fundamental shift in the ethical framework of child welfare, one that prioritizes Indigenous self-determination, cultural preservation, and the well-being of Indigenous families and communities. Only through sustained commitment to these principles can Canada begin to atone for the past and prevent future injustices.

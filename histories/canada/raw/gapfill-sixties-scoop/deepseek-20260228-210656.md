## The Sixties Scoop: A Distinct Catastrophe of Assimilation

The Sixties Scoop (extending into the 1980s) represents a distinct, mass-scale ethical catastrophe in Canadian history, operating as the successor system to residential schools for the forcible assimilation of Indigenous children. While sharing the genocidal intent articulated in the residential school system’s aim to “kill the Indian in the child,” it employed a different legal mechanism: provincial child welfare authority, framed by the secular, “scientific” language of social work and the “best interests of the child.”

### 1. Mechanism and Scale
The primary instrument was the provincial child welfare agency, empowered by legislation like Ontario’s *Child Welfare Act* (1965). These agencies, often with minimal or no cultural competency, apprehended Indigenous children from their families and communities en masse. An estimated **20,000 children** were taken, with some scholars suggesting numbers as high as 40,000. While nationwide, the practice was most acute in the Prairie provinces and Ontario. Manitoba, for instance, saw over **3,000 Indigenous children adopted between 1971 and 1981 alone**, the vast majority into non-Indigenous homes.

### 2. Continuity from Residential Schools
As residential schools began closing in the 1960s—a process accelerated by the integrationist *White Paper* policy (1969)—the child welfare system became the new vehicle for assimilation. Sociologist **Patrick Johnston** definitively named the phenomenon in his 1983 report, *Native Children and the Child Welfare System*, for the Canadian Council on Social Development. He documented how social workers would “scoop” children from reserves with little investigation. The **continuity of intent** is explicit in government documents. A 1966 *Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy* (the Hawthorne Report) noted, paradoxically, that while integration was the goal, child welfare practices were “often seen by Indians as a threat to the continued existence of the band.” This was not a bug but a feature.

### 3. The Ethical Framework of “Child Welfare”
The operating ideology pathologized Indigenous family structures and communal living. **Poverty**, directly created by colonial policies of dispossession and economic marginalization, was used as *prima facie* evidence of neglect. The “best interests of the child” standard, central to statutes like the *British Columbia Family and Child Service Act* (1980), was applied through a monocultural, middle-class Euro-Canadian lens that deemed Indigenous parenting practices—such as extended family care—as deficient. As scholar **Raven Sinclair** (Ôtiskewâpit) notes in “Identity Lost and Found: Lessons from the Sixties Scoop” (2007), social workers wielded “unchecked power,” making decisions that severed children from kin, land, and identity.

### 4. Transracial Adoption and Its Consequences
Children were placed not only in non-Indigenous foster homes across Canada but were also **adopted out to white families in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe**. This resulted in catastrophic losses:
*   **Legal Identity:** Some children lost their status under the *Indian Act* (Section 12(1)(b) at the time, the “enfranchisement” clause), severing their legal tie to their nation.
*   **Cultural Identity:** Loss of language, spiritual teachings, and kinship connections was nearly universal.
*   **Psychological Harm:** Survivors report profound identity confusion, grief, and cultural dislocation, linked to higher rates of mental health struggles, substance use, and suicide. As **Suzanne Fournier and Ernie Crey** document in *Stolen From Our Embrace* (1997), adoptees often grew up with “a sense of existing in a cultural vacuum.”

### 5. Legal Reckoning and Incomplete Justice
Legal accountability came slowly. A landmark moment was **Brown v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 ONSC 251**. The Ontario Superior Court found the federal government liable for the Sixties Scoop, ruling it breached its *“duty of care to take reasonable steps to prevent on-reserve children in Ontario, who were placed in the care of non-Aboriginal foster or adoptive parents, from losing their Aboriginal identity.”* (para 1).
This led to a **$800 million national settlement agreement** in 2017 for status First Nations and Inuit children apprehended between 1951 and 1991, and the creation of a **$50 million Sixties Scoop Healing Foundation**. Manitoba issued a formal apology in 2015. These measures, while significant, are widely viewed by survivors as incomplete justice—financial compensation and apologies cannot restore lost childhoods, lineages, or languages, nor do they address the ongoing system.

### 6. The Ongoing Crisis: A Direct Legacy
The Sixties Scoop never truly ended; it evolved. Today, **Indigenous children represent over 53% of all children in foster care under the age of 14, while constituting only 7.7% of the child population** (2016 Census data). This is a direct legacy of the same prejudicial standards and systemic neglect.
Scholar and activist **Dr. Cindy Blackstock**, Executive Director of the **First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (FNCFCS)**, has led the fight against this discrimination. In a historic ruling, the **Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT)**, in *First Nations Child and Family Caring Society et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2016 CHRT 2*, found Canada’s underfunding of on-reserve child welfare services to be a **systemic racial discrimination** against First Nations children and families (a finding reaffirmed multiple times due to federal non-compliance).
The case also highlighted **Jordan’s Principle**, named for **Jordan River Anderson** (1999-2005), a First Nations child from Norway House Cree Nation who died in hospital while the federal and provincial governments argued for over two years over who would pay for his home care. The CHRT and subsequent orders (e.g., *2017 CHRT 14*) have ordered Canada to fully implement this principle, mandating that the needs of First Nations children come first, without jurisdictional delay.

### Conclusion: An Unfinished Ethical Failure
The Sixties Scoop was a distinct, legally-sanctioned campaign of cultural genocide, leveraging the authority of child welfare to achieve assimilationist ends. Its legacy is not historical but vibrantly, painfully current. The work of scholars like **Raven Sinclair** and the relentless advocacy of **Cindy Blackstock** and the FNCFCS reveal a continuous thread from residential schools, through the Sixties Scoop, to the modern, disproportionate apprehension of Indigenous children. True justice requires not only redress for past harms but the fundamental dismantling of the discriminatory systems that perpetuate them, as repeatedly ordered by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. The catastrophe is not sealed in the past; it is a live, unresolved ethical crisis in Canadian law and social policy.

# The Confederation Period and Nation-Building Era (1867–1945): Constructing Canada’s Ethical Architecture

The period from Confederation to the end of World War II saw the deliberate construction of a Canadian state and a corresponding national ethical framework. This architecture was built on a foundation of **compromise, exclusion, and ordered progress**, creating enduring tensions between the stated ideals of peace, order, and good government and the systemic violence required to achieve them. As historian Ian McKay argues in his “Liberal Order Framework” (2000), this era was defined by the project of establishing a “liberal order” in northern North America—a project that required the suppression of alternative sovereignties and lifeways.

## 1. The Ethical Formula of Confederation: Peace, Order, and Good Government

The **British North America Act, 1867** (now the Constitution Act, 1867) provided Canada’s foundational ethical and legal architecture. Its preamble states the desire for “a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom” and to promote “the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada.”

*   **POGG vs. American Ideals:** The phrase “Peace, Order, and good Government” (POGG) stands in direct contrast to the American “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” POGG prioritizes **collective stability, state authority, and managed development** over individual rights or revolutionary potential. It reflects a Tory-Orange conservative liberalism wary of American-style republicanism and mob rule, as articulated by **John A. Macdonald** and the **Fathers of Confederation**.
*   **What It Suppresses:** POGG implicitly suppresses dissent, conflict, and unmanaged plurality. It provides the constitutional justification for federal emergency powers (e.g., to suspend civil liberties during crises) and frames nation-building as a top-down administrative project. The **division of powers** (Sections 91 and 92) was itself an ethical compromise: federal power over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians” (91.24) and “Criminal Law” (91.27) would become tools of assimilation and control, while provincial control over “Property and Civil Rights” (92.13) and “Education” (92.93) enabled regional cultural battles like the Manitoba Schools Question.
*   **The Ethical Compromise:** Confederation was a bargain between **English-Canadian Protestants** and **French-Canadian Catholics** (represented by **George-Étienne Cartier**), built on a dual promise: French-language and Catholic education rights where numbers warranted, and a strong central government to resist American expansion. Indigenous peoples were not parties to this bargain; their sovereignty was subsumed under federal jurisdiction as a “problem” to be managed.

## 2. The National Policy and the Ethics of Exclusionary Nation-Building

Prime Minister **John A. Macdonald’s National Policy** (1879) was a three-pronged ethical vision for economic and demographic nation-building: protective tariffs to shield Canadian industry, mass immigration to populate the West, and a transcontinental railway to bind it all together.

*   **The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR):** The railway was celebrated as an epic feat of national unity, “the national dream” (as **Donald Creighton** later called it). Its construction, however, relied on the exploitation of **over 15,000 Chinese labourers** who performed the most dangerous work for half the pay of white workers. An estimated 600-1,200 died from accidents, disease, and malnutrition.
*   **The Chinese Head Tax and Exclusion:** The ethical betrayal followed completion. The **Chinese Immigration Act of 1885** imposed a “head tax” of $50 (raised to $500 in 1903) to deter Chinese immigration. The **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923** (repealed only in 1947) banned Chinese immigration almost entirely. The workers who built the literal infrastructure of the nation were deemed unfit to be part of the national community—a clear articulation of Canada’s **racialized ethical boundaries**.

## 3. The Catastrophic Ethical Failure: The Indian Residential School System

The residential school system (operational from the 1830s, massively expanded post-Confederation, with the last school closing in 1996) is the most profound ethical failure in Canadian history, a state-sponsored program of cultural genocide aimed at solving the “Indian problem.”

*   **The Blueprint:** **Nicholas Flood Davin’s “Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds” (1879)** recommended the aggressive, church-run, boarding-school model based on American precedents. The goal was “to kill the Indian in the child.”
*   **The Architect:** **Duncan Campbell Scott**, Deputy Superintendent of the Department of Indian Affairs (1913-1932), embodied the system’s cold logic. In 1920, he stated: “I want to get rid of the Indian problem… Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic.”
*   **Documented Atrocity and Silenced Truth:** Dr. **Peter Bryce**, Chief Medical Officer for the Department of the Interior, authored the **“Report on the Indian Schools of Manitoba and the North-West Territories” (1907)**. He found tuberculosis death rates among students as high as **69%** and condemned the horrific, state-funded conditions. His report was suppressed, and he was forced out of the civil service.
*   **Scale of Harm:** An estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children were forced into 139 schools. The **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015)** documented over 4,100 student deaths, a number it acknowledged was a minimum. The discovery of **unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in 2021** (215 potential burial sites) provided physical, incontrovertible evidence of the system’s mortal toll.

## 4. The Social Gospel and the Emergence of Canadian Social Democracy

In tension with the state’s exclusionary policies, a reformist tradition emerged, often rooted in the **Social Gospel**—the application of Christian ethics to social problems like poverty and inequality.

*   **J.S. Woodsworth:** A Methodist minister and socialist leader, Woodsworth’s **“Strangers Within Our Gates” (1909)** advocated for immigrant support but reflected the era’s racial hierarchies, ranking immigrants by their perceived assimilability. His ethical evolution led him to co-found the **Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)** in 1932, the forerunner of the NDP.
*   **The Winnipeg General Strike (1919):** This massive six-week strike was a national ethical crisis, framed by authorities as a Bolshevik revolt. Its violent suppression on **“Bloody Saturday”** (June 21, 1919) demonstrated the limits of the state’s tolerance for disorder. It radicalized figures like Woodsworth and fueled the movement for democratic socialism.
*   **Tommy Douglas and the CCF:** As CCF Premier of Saskatchewan, **Tommy Douglas** pioneered **universal public hospital insurance (1947)**. This model, grounded in an ethic of **collective care and shared risk**, became the foundation for Canada’s national **medicare** system (Medical Care Act, 1966), a cornerstone of Canadian ethical identity.

## 5. The Manitoba Schools Question (1890): The Template for Cultural Conflict

The **Manitoba Act of 1870** guaranteed denominational (Catholic and Protestant) school rights. In 1890, the provincial government of **Thomas Greenway** passed the **Manitoba Schools Act**, abolishing public funding for Catholic French-language schools.

*   **The Ethical Crisis:** This violated the foundational French-English compact of Confederation. The federal government, led by **Wilfrid Laurier**, brokered a compromise in 1896 that provided limited religious instruction and bilingual teaching where numbers warranted. The precedent was set: **provincial rights could trump minority linguistic/religious guarantees**, establishing a recurring pattern where French-Canadian minorities outside Quebec became vulnerable. This conflict directly prefigured 20th-century battles over official bilingualism and Quebec’s own language laws.

## 6. Wars, Identity, and Civil Liberties

*   **WWI and Vimy Ridge (1917):** The myth of Canada’s “birth of nationhood” at Vimy fostered an ethical identity of **valour, sacrifice, and distinctiveness from Britain**. However, the **Conscription Crisis of 1917** tore open the French-English rift. Quebec, seeing little stake in a “British” war, overwhelmingly opposed conscription, leading to riots and a lasting alienation that reshaped Canadian politics.
*   **Japanese Canadian Internment (1942):** Under the **War Measures Act**, over 22,000 Japanese Canadians were forcibly relocated, their property sold off by the government. This was a clear ethical failure, driven by racism rather than military necessity, paralleling the U.S. experience. The **Persons Case (Edwards v. Canada, 1929)** presented a counter-narrative of ethical expansion. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned the Supreme Court of Canada, ruling that **“women are qualified persons”** eligible for appointment to the Senate. The **“Famous Five”** petitioners (**Emily Murphy, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Irene Parlby**) successfully challenged the exclusionary boundaries of the state, though their advocacy was also marked by the nativist and eugenicist views common among white feminists of the era.

## 7. Scholarly Frameworks

*   **Donald Creighton (“The Commercial Empire of the St. Lawrence,” 1937)** championed a **Laurentian thesis** that framed Canadian history as the triumphant, centralized expansion of an Anglo-Canadian state—a view that later scholars would critique for its marginalization of Indigenous and French-Canadian perspectives.
*   **Ramsay Cook (“Canada and the French-Canadian Question,” 1966)** analyzed the existential conflict between pan-Canadian nationalism and Quebec nationalism, framing Canada as a “compact” between two founding peoples perpetually in need of renegotiation.
*   **J.R. Miller (“Skyscrapers Hide the Heavens,” 1989)** centered Indigenous-settler relations, providing critical scholarship on treaties, resistance, and the residential school system.
*   **Ian McKay (“The Liberal Order Framework,” 2000)** argues that post-Confederation Canada is best understood as a **liberal project** aimed at displacing all other forms of social organization (Indigenous, familial, peasant) with a social order based on individual property rights, capitalist exchange, and state sovereignty. From this view, POGG, the National Policy, and residential schools were not aberrations but **integral tools** in the imposition of this liberal order.

**Conclusion:** The ethical architecture built between 1867 and 1945 was a paradox. It combined a **pragmatic, stability-oriented governance model** (POGG) with a **brutally assimilationist project** aimed at Indigenous peoples and a **racially exclusionary immigration policy**. Alongside this, however, emerged a **social democratic tradition** born from labour struggle and Protestant reformism, which would later challenge the state’s ethical boundaries from within. Canada’s distinctive ethical tradition is defined precisely by this unresolved tension: the gap between the myth of a peaceful, orderly, and just society and the historical record of violence and exclusion required to build and maintain the state itself.

## Canada's Ethical Architecture: Confederation to 1945

The period between Confederation (1867) and the end of World War II (1945) witnessed the construction of Canada's distinctive ethical architecture, a framework defined by both its aspirations and its failures. This era established key tensions that continue to shape Canadian identity and its approach to harm, care, and stewardship.

**1. The British North America Act (1867) and "Peace, Order, and Good Government" (POGG):**

The *British North America Act, 1867* (now the *Constitution Act, 1867*) laid the groundwork for Canada's ethical framework. Unlike the American emphasis on "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness," Canada prioritized "Peace, Order, and Good Government" (POGG). This foundational formula highlights a commitment to stability and social cohesion, potentially at the expense of individual liberties.

*   **POGG Prioritizes:** Social order, collective well-being, and a strong central government.
*   **POGG Suppresses:** Unfettered individualism, radical dissent, and potentially minority rights when they conflict with the perceived "good government."
*   **Federal-Provincial Division of Powers:** This division, enshrined in the *Constitution Act, 1867*, reflects an ethical compromise between central authority and regional autonomy. Provinces retain significant control over areas like education and healthcare, recognizing distinct cultural and social needs. This inherent tension continues to shape debates about national standards versus provincial rights.

Donald Creighton, in *The Forked Road: Canada 1939-1957*, argued that this centralizing impulse was essential to Canada's survival as a distinct nation, a counterpoint to American individualism.

**2. The National Policy and the CPR: Ethics of Inclusion and Exclusion:**

John A. Macdonald's National Policy, initiated in 1879, aimed to build a unified Canada through tariffs, immigration, and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). This nation-building project embodied a particular ethical vision:

*   **Inclusion through Infrastructure:** The CPR promised to connect disparate regions and facilitate trade, integrating the country economically and politically.
*   **Exclusion through Discrimination:** The human cost of this project reveals a profound ethical failure. Chinese labourers were instrumental in building the CPR, facing dangerous conditions and discriminatory wages. However, after the railway's completion, the government implemented the *Chinese Head Tax* (1885) and the *Chinese Exclusion Act* (1923), effectively barring Chinese immigration and separating families. This legislation directly contradicts any claim to universal ethical principles and reveals a racialized hierarchy of belonging.

**3. Residential Schools: The Catastrophic Ethical Failure:**

The residential school system, operating from the 1830s to 1996, represents the most devastating ethical failure in Canadian history.

*   **The System:** Government-funded, church-run schools aimed to assimilate Indigenous children by forcibly removing them from their families and cultures.
*   **"Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds" (1879):** Nicholas Flood Davin's report advocated for residential schools as a tool of assimilation, arguing that Indigenous cultures were inherently inferior.
*   **Duncan Campbell Scott's Goal:** As Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Scott infamously stated, "I want to get rid of the Indian problem," reflecting a policy of cultural genocide.
*   **Specific Schools, Abuses, and Death Counts:** Schools like Kamloops Indian Residential School, St. Anne's Indian Residential School, and many others were sites of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Malnutrition and disease were rampant.
*   **The Bryce Report (1907):** Medical inspector Dr. Peter Bryce documented the shockingly high rates of tuberculosis in residential schools, revealing systemic neglect and negligence. His findings were suppressed by the government.
*   **Unmarked Graves (Kamloops, 2021):** The discovery of unmarked graves at the Kamloops Indian Residential School sparked national and international outrage, forcing a reckoning with the legacy of the residential school system and the ongoing trauma it inflicts on Indigenous communities.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), in its final report (2015), concluded that the residential school system constituted cultural genocide. This stands as a stark indictment of Canada's self-proclaimed ethical image.

**4. The Social Gospel and Canadian Progressivism: Seeds of Social Democracy:**

Despite the systemic injustices of the era, the Social Gospel movement and Canadian progressivism emerged as forces for social reform.

*   **J.S. Woodsworth:** A Methodist minister and social reformer, Woodsworth advocated for social justice and immigrant rights. However, his book *Strangers Within Our Gates* (1909) also reveals the troubling racial hierarchies inherent in early progressive thought, prioritizing assimilation and Anglo-conformity.
*   **Tommy Douglas and the CCF:** Douglas, a Baptist minister and politician, led the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a social democratic party that championed universal healthcare, social security, and public ownership.
*   **The Winnipeg General Strike (1919):** This strike, sparked by labour unrest and demands for better working conditions, exposed deep class divisions and the government's willingness to use force to suppress dissent.
*   **Origins of Canadian Social Democracy:** The Social Gospel and the CCF laid the foundation for Canada's social safety net, including medicare, unemployment insurance, and public broadcasting, reflecting a commitment to collective responsibility and social welfare.

**5. The Manitoba Schools Question (1890): Ethics of Language and Culture:**

The Manitoba Schools Question, arising in 1890, centered on the province's decision to abolish public funding for Catholic schools, which primarily served the Francophone population. This dispute raised fundamental questions about:

*   **Language Rights:** The right to education in one's own language.
*   **Catholic Education:** The role of denominational schools in a pluralistic society.
*   **Federal-Provincial Jurisdiction:** The balance of power between the federal government and the provinces in matters of education and culture.

This conflict established a template for subsequent language and culture debates in Canada, highlighting the ongoing tension between national unity and the protection of minority rights.

**6. WWI, Vimy Ridge, and WWII: Nationhood Forged in Conflict:**

World War I and World War II played a significant role in shaping Canadian national identity.

*   **Vimy Ridge Mythology:** The Battle of Vimy Ridge (1917) became a symbol of Canadian courage and sacrifice, contributing to a sense of national pride and independence from Britain.
*   **Conscription Crisis (1917):** The decision to implement conscription during WWI deepened the divide between English and French Canada. Francophones, feeling alienated from the war effort, strongly opposed conscription, leading to violent protests and a lasting sense of betrayal.
*   **Japanese Canadian Internment (1942):** During WWII, the Canadian government interned Japanese Canadians, seizing their property and denying them basic rights. This act, mirroring similar actions in the United States, represents a profound violation of civil liberties and a betrayal of Canadian values.
*   **The Persons Case (1929):** This landmark court case, brought by the "Famous Five," challenged the legal definition of "persons" to include women, allowing them to serve in the Senate. While a victory for gender equality, the case also reflects the slow and uneven progress towards full inclusion.

**7. Key Scholars and Interpretations:**

*   **Donald Creighton:** A conservative historian who emphasized the importance of a strong central government and British traditions in shaping Canadian identity.
*   **Ramsay Cook:** Explored the complexities of Canadian nationalism and the tension between regionalism and national unity.
*   **J.R. Miller:** Examined the history of Indigenous-settler relations in Canada, highlighting the injustices and inequalities faced by Indigenous peoples.
*   **Ian McKay:** Developed the "Liberal Order Framework" to analyze Canadian history, arguing that Canada's political and social development has been shaped by a dominant liberal ideology that prioritizes individual rights, free markets, and limited government. This framework also acknowledges the exclusions and inequalities that have been perpetuated by this order.

In conclusion, the period between Confederation and 1945 laid the foundation for Canada's distinctive ethical architecture. While marked by achievements in nation-building and social reform, it was also marred by profound ethical failures, particularly in the treatment of Indigenous peoples and minority groups. These successes and failures continue to shape Canada's ongoing struggle to reconcile its self-image with its historical record, and to build a truly just and equitable society.

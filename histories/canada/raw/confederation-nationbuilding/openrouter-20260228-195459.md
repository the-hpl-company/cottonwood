### Canada's Ethical Architecture: Confederation to Nation-Building (1867-1945)

#### 1. **The British North America Act (1867)**  
The **British North America Act** established Canada’s foundational ethical architecture with the phrase **“Peace, Order, and Good Government” (POGG)**. Contrasted with America’s “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,” POGG prioritized collective stability over individual liberty, emphasizing unity, federalism, and gradual reform over revolution. This ethical formula reflected Canada’s colonial heritage and its desire to avoid the revolutionary violence of the United States.  

POGG suppressed dissent and Indigenous sovereignty, embedding federal control over Indigenous peoples (Section 91(24)) and suppressing French-Canadian and Indigenous autonomy. The **federal-provincial division of powers** (Sections 91-92) was an ethical compromise between centralization (favored by English Canada) and provincial autonomy (favored by French Canada), but it entrenched colonial hierarchies that marginalized Indigenous nations.

#### 2. **The National Policy and the CPR**  
**John A. Macdonald’s National Policy** (1879) envisioned Canada as a unified nation through tariffs, immigration, and the **Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)**. The railroad symbolized ethical nation-building: connecting the country, fostering economic growth, and uniting disparate regions.  

However, this vision was built on exclusionary ethics. The **Chinese head tax (1885)** and **Chinese Exclusion Act (1923)** targeted Chinese railway workers, who were essential to building the CPR but were denied citizenship and rights. This ethical contradiction—exploiting labor while excluding laborers—revealed the limits of Canada’s nation-building ideals.

#### 3. **Residential Schools**  
The residential school system (1831-1996) represents Canada’s most catastrophic ethical failure. **Nicholas Flood Davin’s Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds (1879)** recommended assimilation through education, leading to the establishment of residential schools. **Duncan Campbell Scott**, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, infamously stated in 1920, **“I want to get rid of the Indian problem.”**  

Specific schools, such as **Kamloops Indian Residential School**, became sites of systemic abuse, neglect, and death. The **Bryce Report (1907)**, authored by Dr. Peter Bryce, documented tuberculosis death rates of up to **24%** among Indigenous children in residential schools, but his findings were suppressed. The discovery of **unmarked graves** at Kamloops in 2021 (215 children confirmed) underscored the horrific legacy of this system.

#### 4. **The Social Gospel and Progressivism**  
The **Social Gospel movement** inspired Canadian progressivism, blending Christian ethics with social reform. **J.S. Woodsworth**, in **Strangers Within Our Gates (1909)**, advocated for immigrant rights but reinforced troubling racial hierarchies, reflecting the tensions in Canada’s ethical progressivism.  

The **Winnipeg General Strike (1919)** became an ethical crisis, exposing class divisions and labor exploitation. This period birthed Canadian social democracy, exemplified by **Tommy Douglas** and the **Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)**. Ethical achievements like **medicare** and the **social safety net** emerged from this tradition, balancing collective care with economic justice.

#### 5. **The Manitoba Schools Question (1890)**  
The **Manitoba Schools Question (1890)** tested Canada’s ethical commitment to minority rights. Manitoba abolished funding for Catholic schools, violating the rights of French-Canadian Catholics. The federal government’s intervention (the **Remedial Act**, 1896) highlighted the tension between provincial autonomy and minority protections. This conflict became the template for subsequent language and culture debates, including the **Official Languages Act (1969)**.

#### 6. **War, Internment, and Rights**  
**WWI** and **Vimy Ridge (1917)** mythologized Canadian bravery but revealed ethical fractures. The **Conscription Crisis (1917)** divided French and English Canada, with French Canadians resisting mandatory military service.  

During **WWII**, the **internment of Japanese Canadians (1942)** paralleled U.S. injustices, violating the rights of over 22,000 individuals. The **Persons Case (1929)**, led by the **Famous Five** (Emily Murphy, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Henrietta Edwards, and Irene Parlby), affirmed women’s legal personhood, marking a milestone in Canada’s ethical evolution.

#### 7. **Key Scholars**  
- **Donald Creighton**: Celebrated Macdonald’s nation-building but ignored its exclusionary ethics.  
- **Ramsay Cook**: Analyzed the tension between Quebec’s nationalism and Canadian federalism.  
- **J.R. Miller**: Chronicled the residential school system’s devastating impact.  
- **Ian McKay**: Developed the **Liberal Order Framework**, critiquing Canada’s liberal hegemony and its suppression of alternative visions.

### Conclusion  
The Confederation and nation-building period constructed Canada’s distinctive ethical architecture, balancing collective stability with systemic exclusion. The tension between Canada’s self-image (peacekeeping, multicultural) and its record (colonial, assimilationist) defines its ethical tradition. This period laid the groundwork for ongoing struggles over Indigenous rights, minority protections, and social justice.

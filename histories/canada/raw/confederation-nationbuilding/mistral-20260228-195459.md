### **The Confederation Period and Nation-Building Era (1867–1945): Constructing Canada’s Ethical Architecture**

Canada’s ethical architecture was forged in the crucible of Confederation, nation-building, and state consolidation—an era defined by competing visions of order, progress, and belonging. Unlike the United States, which grounded its founding in revolutionary ideals of individual liberty, Canada’s ethical framework emerged from a conservative, statist, and often coercive project of *Peace, Order, and Good Government* (POGG). This period was marked by profound contradictions: the promise of a just federation alongside the violent suppression of Indigenous nations; the celebration of multiculturalism’s precursors alongside racial exclusion; and the rise of social democracy alongside state-sanctioned assimilation. Below, we trace the key ethical tensions, documents, and movements that shaped Canada’s moral identity.

### **1. The British North America Act (1867): The Ethical Architecture of Confederation**
**Document:** *Constitution Act, 1867* (formerly the *British North America Act*)

The *Constitution Act, 1867* did not emerge from a revolutionary moment but from a pragmatic negotiation among British North American colonies seeking economic stability and defense against American expansionism. Its ethical core was **Peace, Order, and Good Government (POGG)**, a phrase embedded in the preamble and Section 91, which granted the federal government residual powers.

#### **POGG vs. "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"**
- **POGG as an ethical formula** prioritized **collective stability over individual rights**, **state authority over popular sovereignty**, and **gradual reform over radical change**. Where the U.S. Declaration of Independence (1776) enshrined negative liberties (freedom *from* government), POGG enshrined positive governance (freedom *through* government).
- **What POGG suppressed:**
  - **Indigenous sovereignty** – The *Constitution Act* made "Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians" a federal responsibility (Section 91(24)), but this was not a recognition of nationhood; it was a tool for assimilation. The *Indian Act* (1876) would later criminalize Indigenous cultural practices (e.g., potlatches, sun dances) under POGG’s "good government" mandate.
  - **Provincial autonomy** – The federal government’s power to disallow provincial laws (Section 90) was used to override local democracy (e.g., Manitoba’s *Official Language Act*, 1890, which abolished French-language rights).
  - **Dissent** – The *War Measures Act* (1914), justified under POGG, suspended civil liberties during WWI and the October Crisis (1970).

#### **The Federal-Provincial Division of Powers as Ethical Compromise**
The *Constitution Act* divided authority between federal and provincial governments, reflecting competing visions of Canada:
- **Federal powers (Section 91):** Trade, criminal law, Indigenous affairs, defense, and "residual" powers (POGG).
- **Provincial powers (Section 92):** Education, healthcare, natural resources, and "property and civil rights."

This division was an **ethical compromise** between:
- **Centralizers (John A. Macdonald, George-Étienne Cartier)** – Who saw a strong federal state as necessary for economic development and national unity.
- **Provincial rights advocates (Ontario’s Oliver Mowat, Quebec’s Honoré Mercier)** – Who feared federal overreach and sought to protect local cultures (e.g., Catholic education in Quebec).

The tension between these visions would define Canadian federalism, from the *Manitoba Schools Question* (1890) to Quebec’s *Quiet Revolution* (1960s).

### **2. The National Policy and the CPR: Nation-Building Through Infrastructure (and Exclusion)**
**Key Figure:** **John A. Macdonald** (Canada’s first Prime Minister, 1867–1873, 1878–1891)
**Policy:** *The National Policy* (1879) – A three-pronged economic strategy:
1. **Protective tariffs** (to build Canadian industry).
2. **Western settlement** (to counter American expansion).
3. **The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)** (to bind the country together).

#### **The Ethics of Nation-Building Through Infrastructure**
Macdonald’s vision was **teleological**: Canada’s destiny was to stretch from sea to sea, and the state had a moral duty to make it so. The CPR was not just an economic project but a **civilizing mission**—a way to "open" the West to European settlement.

- **The CPR as ethical achievement:**
  - Completed in 1885, it enabled the suppression of the **North-West Rebellion** (1885), where Métis leader **Louis Riel** was hanged for treason—a defining moment in Canada’s treatment of Indigenous and Métis peoples.
  - It facilitated the **settlement of the Prairies**, turning Indigenous territories into farmland under the *Dominion Lands Act* (1872).

- **The CPR as ethical failure:**
  - **Chinese railway workers** – 15,000–17,000 Chinese laborers were brought in to build the most dangerous sections of the CPR (e.g., the Fraser Canyon). Hundreds died from accidents, landslides, and disease. Despite their sacrifice, they were paid **half the wages** of white workers and excluded from the *Last Spike* ceremony (1885).
  - **The Chinese Head Tax (1885)** – The *Chinese Immigration Act* imposed a $50 tax on Chinese immigrants (later raised to $500 in 1903). This was the first instance of **state-sanctioned racial discrimination** in Canadian law.
  - **The Chinese Exclusion Act (1923)** – Banned Chinese immigration entirely until 1947.

**Ethical paradox:** The CPR was built on **exploited labor and racial exclusion**, yet it became a symbol of Canadian unity. This tension—between **nation-building and racial hierarchy**—would recur in policies like the *Continuous Journey Regulation* (1908, targeting South Asians) and the *Komagata Maru* incident (1914).

### **3. Residential Schools: Canada’s Most Catastrophic Ethical Failure**
**System:** *Indian Residential School System* (1831–1996)
**Key Documents:**
- **Nicholas Flood Davin, *Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds*** (1879) – Recommended boarding schools to "civilize" Indigenous children.
- **Duncan Campbell Scott, *Department of Indian Affairs Annual Report*** (1920) – "I want to get rid of the Indian problem. Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic."
- **Dr. Peter Bryce, *The Story of a National Crime*** (1922) – Documented tuberculosis death rates of **24–42%** in residential schools but was **ignored by the government**.

#### **The System’s Ethical Logic: Cultural Genocide**
Residential schools were not just educational institutions; they were **tools of assimilation** designed to "kill the Indian in the child." The system was:
- **Coercive** – The *Indian Act* (1876) made attendance **mandatory** for Indigenous children (amended in 1920 to enforce removal from families).
- **Violent** – Physical, sexual, and psychological abuse was **systemic**. Survivors’ testimonies (e.g., *Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples*, 1996; *Truth and Reconciliation Commission*, 2015) detail **beating, starvation, and medical experimentation**.
- **Lethal** – The **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)** estimated **4,100–6,000 children died** in residential schools, though the number is likely higher. **Unmarked graves** (e.g., **Kamloops, 2021: 215+; Marieval, 2021: 751+**) confirm that many were **buried without records**.

#### **Key Schools and Abuses:**
- **Mohawk Institute (Brantford, ON, 1831–1970)** – Known as the "Mush Hole" for its starvation rations.
- **St. Anne’s (Fort Albany, ON, 1902–1976)** – Survivors reported **electric chairs** used for punishment.
- **Lejac (Fraser Lake, BC, 1922–1976)** – **Four boys froze to death** trying to escape in 1937.

#### **The Bryce Report (1907) and Government Complicity**
Dr. Peter Bryce, Canada’s chief medical officer, found that **tuberculosis death rates in residential schools were 20 times higher** than in the general population. His report was **suppressed**, and he was **forced out of the civil service**. This was not negligence; it was **state policy**.

**Ethical legacy:** The residential school system was not an aberration but a **cornerstone of Canadian nation-building**. As historian **J.R. Miller** (*Residential Schools and Reconciliation*, 2017) argues, it was part of a **larger project of dispossession**—the *Indian Act*, the *pass system*, and the **outlawing of Indigenous governance** (e.g., the **potlatch ban, 1884–1951**).

### **4. The Social Gospel and Canadian Progressivism: The Rise of Social Democracy**
**Key Figures:**
- **J.S. Woodsworth** (*Strangers Within Our Gates*, 1909) – Methodist minister, CCF founder, and social reformer.
- **Tommy Douglas** – Baptist minister, CCF premier of Saskatchewan (1944–1961), father of **Medicare (1962)**.
- **The Winnipeg General Strike (1919)** – A defining moment in Canadian labor history.

#### **The Social Gospel: Christianity as Social Justice**
The **Social Gospel movement** (1880s–1930s) applied Christian ethics to **poverty, labor rights, and immigration**. Its key tenets:
- **Salvation through social reform** – Sin was not just personal but **structural** (e.g., capitalism, racism).
- **The Kingdom of God on Earth** – A vision of a **cooperative commonwealth** (later adopted by the **Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, CCF, 1932**).

#### **J.S. Woodsworth: Progressivism and Its Limits**
Woodsworth’s *Strangers Within Our Gates* (1909) was a **progressive tract** advocating for immigrant rights—but it also **ranked races** in a hierarchy, with Anglo-Saxons at the top. This **racial paternalism** reflected the era’s contradictions:
- **Achievements:**
  - **Labor rights** – Woodsworth helped found the **CCF (1932)**, Canada’s first socialist party.
  - **Immigration reform** – He opposed the **Chinese Exclusion Act (1923)** and advocated for **non-discriminatory immigration**.
- **Failures:**
  - **Eugenics** – Woodsworth supported **sterilization laws** (e.g., Alberta’s *Sexual Sterilization Act*, 1928).
  - **Assimilationism** – He believed in **gradual integration** of immigrants, not multiculturalism.

#### **The Winnipeg General Strike (1919): Ethical Crisis of Labor vs. Capital**
- **What happened:** 30,000 workers walked off the job in Winnipeg, demanding **fair wages, collective bargaining, and an 8-hour workday**.
- **Government response:** The federal government, under **Arthur Meighen**, sent in the **Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP)**, who **fired on strikers**, killing two.
- **Ethical significance:**
  - **Class as a Canadian fault line** – The strike exposed the **violence of capitalism** and the state’s role in suppressing labor.
  - **Precursor to social democracy** – The strike radicalized workers, leading to the **CCF’s formation (1932)** and later **Medicare (1962)**.

#### **Tommy Douglas and the CCF: The Ethical Foundations of Canadian Social Democracy**
- **Key achievements:**
  - **Saskatchewan’s Medicare (1962)** – The first **universal healthcare system** in North America.
  - **Public broadcasting (CBC, 1936)** – A **cultural nationalist** project to counter American media dominance.
- **Ethical vision:** Douglas believed in **economic democracy**—that **healthcare, education, and housing** were **rights, not privileges**.

**Legacy:** The CCF (later the **NDP**) embedded **social democracy** into Canada’s ethical framework, distinguishing it from the **laissez-faire capitalism** of the U.S.

### **5. The Manitoba Schools Question (1890): The Ethics of Language and Culture**
**Key Event:** Manitoba’s *Official Language Act* (1890) – Abolished French as an official language and **defunded Catholic schools**.

#### **Ethical Tensions:**
1. **Minority rights vs. provincial autonomy** – Should the federal government protect **French-Catholic education** in a majority-English province?
2. **Assimilation vs. pluralism** – Was Manitoba’s law a **legitimate exercise of provincial rights** or an **attack on minority culture**?
3. **Federal power vs. provincial rights** – Could Ottawa **disallow** a provincial law under POGG?

#### **The Laurier-Greenway Compromise (1896)**
- **Wilfrid Laurier** (Canada’s first French-Canadian PM) struck a deal with Manitoba Premier **Thomas Greenway**:
  - **French instruction** would be allowed **where numbers warranted**.
  - **Catholic schools** would receive **limited funding**.
- **Ethical outcome:** A **temporary truce**, but the issue **festered**, leading to:
  - **Quebec’s Quiet Revolution (1960s)** – A backlash against **Catholic dominance** but also a **reassertion of French-Canadian nationalism**.
  - **Official Bilingualism (1969)** – Pierre Trudeau’s response to Quebec’s demands.

**Legacy:** The *Manitoba Schools Question* set the template for **every subsequent Canadian language/culture conflict**, from **Quebec’s Bill 101 (1977)** to **New Brunswick’s Official Languages Act (1969)**.

### **6. War, Internment, and the Birth of Canadian Identity**
#### **WWI and Vimy Ridge: The Myth of National Birth**
- **Vimy Ridge (1917)** – A **military victory** (Canada’s first as an independent force) that became a **national myth**.
- **Ethical problem:** The **Vimy myth** (that Canada "came of age" at war) **erased**:
  - **French-Canadian opposition** to conscription (see below).
  - **Indigenous and Black soldiers** (e.g., **No. 2 Construction Battalion**, Canada’s only all-Black unit, which was **segregated and denied combat roles**).
  - **The war’s futility** – 66,000 Canadians died for **minimal territorial gains**.

#### **The Conscription Crisis (1917): French-English Ethical Rupture**
- **What happened:** PM **Robert Borden** introduced **conscription (1917)** to replenish troops.
- **French-Canadian response:** **Massive opposition**—Quebec saw the war as a **British imperial conflict**, not Canada’s.
- **Borden’s response:** The **Military Service Act (1917)** and **Wartime Elections Act (1917)**, which **disenfranchised** conscientious objectors and **granted votes to soldiers’ wives** (to secure a pro-conscription majority).
- **Ethical legacy:**
  - **Quebec’s alienation** – The crisis deepened **French-Canadian nationalism** (e.g., **Henri Bourassa’s** *Le Devoir*).
  - **The "two solitudes"** – A **permanent divide** between English and French Canada.

#### **WWI and Japanese Canadian Internment (1942): The Ethics of Racial Exclusion**
- **What happened:** After **Pearl Harbor (1941)**, 22,000 Japanese Canadians were **forcibly relocated**, their property **confiscated**, and many **deported to Japan** after the war.
- **Legal basis:** The *War Measures Act* (1914) and *Defence of Canada Regulations* (1942).
- **Ethical parallels to U.S. internment:**
  - **Racial profiling** – Unlike German or Italian Canadians, **Japanese Canadians were targeted based on ethnicity**.
  - **Economic dispossession** – The **Custodian of Enemy Property** sold off homes, businesses, and fishing boats.
  - **Post-war deportations** – **4,000 Japanese Canadians** were **forcibly repatriated** to Japan.
- **Redress (1988):** PM **Brian Mulroney** issued a **formal apology** and **$21,000 per survivor**—but the **ethical stain remains**.

#### **The Persons Case (1929): "Are Women Persons?"**
- **Key figures:** The **Famous Five** (Emily Murphy, Nellie McClung, Irene Parlby, Louise McKinney, Henrietta Muir Edwards).
- **Legal battle:** The **British Privy Council** (Canada’s highest court at the time) ruled that **women were "persons" under the *BNA Act*** and could be appointed to the Senate.
- **Ethical significance:**
  - **A victory for gender equality** – But **limited**: Indigenous and Asian women were still **disenfranchised**.
  - **The limits of liberalism** – The case was **not about universal rights** but about **white, middle-class women’s inclusion** in the political system.

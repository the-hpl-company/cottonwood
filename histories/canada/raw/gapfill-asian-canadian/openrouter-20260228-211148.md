The history of Asian Canadians is a narrative of profound ethical tensions: a story of inclusion through labour and exclusion through law, of nation-building by those deemed unfit to belong, and of resilience in the face of systemic racism. This tradition, marked by both systemic violence and the struggle for redress, reveals the contradictions of Canadian multiculturalism. Below is a substantive analysis of key moments and themes.

### 1. Chinese Railway Workers (1881-1885)
The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) relied heavily on the labour of 15,000-17,000 Chinese workers, who were paid significantly less than their white counterparts and subjected to hazardous working conditions. Estimates of deaths range from 600 to 2,200, many from dynamite explosions, landslides, and disease. The ethical calculus of this period is stark: Chinese labour was deemed expendable for the project of nation-building. These workers operated within their own ethical frameworks, rooted in Confucian ideals of familial duty and sojourner ethics—the notion of temporarily leaving home to provide for one’s family. Their remittances sustained families in Guangdong, even as they faced systemic dehumanization in Canada. The CPR’s completion in 1885 was celebrated as a national triumph, but it was built on the backs of racialized workers who were immediately targeted by exclusionary policies.

### 2. The Chinese Head Tax (1885-1923) and Exclusion Act (1923-1947)
The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 imposed a $50 head tax on Chinese immigrants, which was raised to $500 in 1903—equivalent to two years’ wages. The Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 (commonly known as the Exclusion Act) banned Chinese immigration entirely, a policy that remained in place until 1947. These laws exemplified the paradox of a nation built by Chinese labour but unwilling to accept Chinese people as citizens. The ethical implications are profound: Canada’s economic development relied on exploited labour, yet its immigration policies reflected a commitment to racial hierarchy. The redress movement, led by organizations like the Ontario Coalition of Chinese Head Tax Payers and Families, culminated in Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s formal apology in 2006. Individual payments of $20,000 were made to surviving head tax payers and their spouses, though the apology was criticized for not addressing broader systemic racism.

### 3. The Komagata Maru Incident (1914)
The Komagata Maru incident is a defining moment in Canadian exclusionary history. In 1914, 376 passengers, mostly Sikhs, were denied entry to Vancouver despite being British subjects. They were held for two months in the harbor under the "continuous journey" regulation, which required immigrants to arrive directly from their country of origin—a policy designed to exclude South Asians. The passengers mounted a legal challenge, but the courts upheld the regulation. Forced to return to India, the ship arrived in Budge Budge, where British troops fired on the passengers, killing 20. The incident underscores the race-neutral façade of Canadian immigration policies and their violent consequences. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2016 apology acknowledged this historical injustice, though critics noted the apology came over a century too late.

### 4. Japanese Canadian Internment (1942-1949)
Following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, 22,000 Japanese Canadians were forcibly uprooted from their homes under the War Measures Act. Their property was confiscated and sold, often at a fraction of its value. After the war, Japanese Canadians were forced to move east of the Rockies or “repatriate” to Japan, even if they were Canadian-born. The ethical failure here is twofold: the violation of civil liberties and the systemic erasure of Japanese Canadian communities. The redress movement, spearheaded by the National Association of Japanese Canadians, led to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney’s 1988 apology and individual payments of $21,000. Joy Kogawa’s novel *Obasan* (1981) stands as a powerful ethical testimony to this period, documenting the trauma and resilience of Japanese Canadians.

### 5. South Asian Canadian Traditions
South Asian Canadians have long contributed to Canada’s social and political fabric, often in defiance of exclusionary policies. The Ghadar Party, founded in British Columbia and Oregon in 1913, was an anti-colonial movement advocating for India’s independence from British rule. The Khalsa Diwan Society, established in 1906, played a crucial role in Sikh institution-building, including the construction of gurdwaras. The Air India bombing of 1985, which killed 329 people, remains the largest mass murder in Canadian history. The botched investigation and the framing of the tragedy as “an Indian problem” reflect the ethical failures of Canadian institutions to fully recognize South Asian Canadians as equal citizens.

### 6. Contemporary Issues
The “model minority” myth obscures the diversity and struggles of Asian Canadians, framing them as uniformly successful while ignoring systemic barriers. The Live-in Caregiver Program, which disproportionately employs Filipino caregivers, exemplifies the exploitation of racialized labour in exchange for immigration opportunities. The international student pipeline, while economically lucrative, often leaves students vulnerable to exploitation and precarious living conditions. The rise of Asian Canadian political participation, including figures like Jagmeet Singh and Bonnie Crombie, raises questions about the ethics of representation and the responsibilities of political leaders to address systemic racism.

### 7. Key Scholars
Scholars like Henry Yu (*The Annals of the Chinese Historical Society*), Mona Oikawa, Lisa Mar, Nayan Shah, and Enakshi Dua have critically examined the intersections of race, labour, and immigration in Canadian history. Their work challenges the myth of “polite Canada” and highlights the systemic violence underpinning Canadian nation-building.

The Asian Canadian ethical tradition is one of resilience and resistance, marked by the struggle for inclusion and justice in the face of systemic exclusion. It reveals the contradictions of Canadian multiculturalism and the ongoing need for ethical reckoning.

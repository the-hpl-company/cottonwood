## Asian Canadian Ethical Traditions: From Exclusion to Redress

The Asian Canadian ethical tradition is forged in the contradiction between foundational labor and systemic exclusion, evolving through community resilience, legal struggle, and movements for redress that have fundamentally challenged Canada’s self-conception as a just society.

### 1. The CPR’s Chinese Railway Workers: Expendable Labor & Sojourner Ethics (1881-1885)
An estimated 15,000-17,000 Chinese laborers were contracted to build the British Columbia section of the Canadian Pacific Railway, performing the most dangerous work for half the wage of white workers. Conservative estimates place deaths at over 600, though community histories suggest 2,200 or more perished from dynamite blasts, landslides, disease, and exposure. The **ethical calculus of Canadian nation-building** was explicit: racialized labor was a disposable instrument for Confederation’s material precondition—a transcontinental railway. As Prime Minister John A. Macdonald told Parliament in 1882, defending the use of Chinese labor: “It is simply a question of alternatives: either you must have this labour or you can’t have the railway” (House of Commons Debates).

The workers operated within distinct ethical frameworks largely erased from official history. **Confucian familial duty (xiao 孝)** and the **sojourner (huaqiao 華僑) ethic** framed their sacrifice as a temporary ordeal to remit earnings to sustain lineages in Guangdong’s Pearl River Delta. This created a **transpacific ethics of obligation**, where endurance of brutal conditions was a moral duty to family and future. Their presence, however, was deemed temporary by design; as CPR financier Henry Cambie wrote, “When the railway is finished, the Chinamen will be shipped home again” (quoted in *The Annals of the Chinese Historical Society of the Pacific Northwest*, 1983). The ethical breach lies in a nation built literally upon their bones while denying their humanity and right to belong.

### 2. The Chinese Head Tax & Exclusion Act: Legislated Racial Hierarchy (1885-1947)
Following the railway’s completion, Canada moved swiftly to restrict Chinese immigration. The **Chinese Immigration Act of 1885** imposed a **$50 “head tax”** on every Chinese person entering Canada, raised to **$100 in 1900**, and then to **$500 in 1903**—equivalent to two years’ wages for a laborer. This was a deliberate policy of deterrence through financial penalty, extracting over **$23 million** from approximately 81,000 Chinese immigrants. The ultimate exclusion came with the **Chinese Immigration Act, 1923 (the “Exclusion Act”)**, which banned virtually all Chinese immigration until its repeal in 1947. The ethical violation was profound: a nation that exploited Chinese labor for existential infrastructure then legislated their community’s demographic strangulation, separating families for decades.

The **Redress Movement**, led by the **National Congress of Chinese Canadians (NCCC)**, framed this not as historical grievance but as an ongoing constitutional injury requiring moral repair. After decades of activism, Prime Minister **Stephen Harper issued a formal apology in the House of Commons on June 22, 2006**, stating the policies were “motivated by a misguided notion of racial superiority.” The government established a **$20,000 symbolic ex gratia payment** to surviving head-tax payers and spouses, and funded community historical recognition programs. Scholar **Lisa Mar** (*Brotown’s Palaces*, 2010) notes the settlement’s limitation: it addressed a specific legislated wrong but not the broader anti-Asian foundations of early Canadian immigration policy.

### 3. The Komagata Maru: “Continuous Journey” as Race-Neutral Racism (1914)
The **Komagata Maru incident** crystallized the ethics of exclusion under the guise of legal neutrality. In May 1914, the Japanese steamship **Komagata Maru**, chartered by Sikh entrepreneur Gurdit Singh, arrived in Vancouver with 376 British subjects from Punjab (340 Sikh, 24 Muslim, 12 Hindu). They were denied entry under the **“continuous journey” regulation** (Order-in-Council P.C. 920, 1908), which required immigrants to come via a direct, unbroken voyage from their country of origin—an impossible condition given no shipping company offered direct passage from India to Canada.

The passengers mounted a **legal challenge led by Punjabi millworker and community organizer Husain Rahim**, arguing as British subjects they had the right to enter any part of the Empire. The **British Columbia Court of Appeal**, in *Re Munshi Singh* (1914), upheld the government’s exclusion, deferring to executive authority on immigration. After a **two-month standoff** in Vancouver’s harbor, under threat from the naval vessel HMCS *Rainbow*, the ship was forced to return to India. There, at **Budge Budge near Calcutta on September 29, 1914**, British troops fired upon the passengers, killing 20. The ethical framework here is what scholar **Nayan Shah** (*Stranger Intimacy*, 2011) identifies as the construction of the **“dangerous migrant”**—a racialized figure deemed inherently unassimilable and threatening to the “white man’s country.”

Prime Minister **Justin Trudeau’s apology in the House of Commons on May 18, 2016**, explicitly named the incident as rooted in “Canada’s shameful” racist laws, though it came over a century late and after decades of community advocacy, including a previous, widely criticized apology by Prime Minister Stephen Harper at a 2008 community event.

### 4. Japanese Canadian Internment & Dispossession: State Violation as “Security” (1942-1949)
Following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, the Canadian government used the **War Measures Act** to issue **Order-in-Council P.C. 1486 (February 24, 1942)**, forcibly removing over **22,000 Japanese Canadians**—75% of whom were naturalized or native-born citizens—from a 100-mile “protected area” along the BC coast. They were interned in camps in the BC interior, sent to sugar beet farms in Alberta and Manitoba, or placed in prisoner-of-war camps. The **ethical catastrophe deepened with state-sanctioned theft**: the **Custodian of Enemy Property** confiscated and sold homes, businesses, fishing boats, and personal belongings, proceeds from which were used to pay for the internment itself.

Post-war, the government sought to permanently disperse the community through **Order-in-Council P.C. 7356 (December 15, 1945)**, forcing Japanese Canadians to choose between **“repatriation” to Japan** (a country many had never seen) or **moving east of the Rockies**. The **National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC)**, led by figures like **Art Miki**, waged a decades-long redress campaign. Their victory came with Prime Minister **Brian Mulroney’s formal apology on September 22, 1988**, and the **Canadian Japanese Agreement** providing **$21,000 in individual compensation** to survivors, a $12 million community fund, and expungement of criminal records for those who violated wartime orders.

The ethical testimony of this trauma is powerfully rendered in **Joy Kogawa’s novel *Obasan* (1981)**, which uses silence, documentation, and memory to confront the “stone bread” of state betrayal. Scholar **Mona Oikawa** (*Cartographies of Violence*, 2012) analyzes how the state constructed Japanese Canadians as an “enemy race,” rendering them vulnerable to totalizing violence under the logic of security.

### 5. South Asian Canadian Traditions: Ghadar, Institution-Building & the Air India Tragedy
South Asian communities developed ethical traditions of anti-colonial resistance and institution-building. The **Ghadar Party**, founded in **Astoria, Oregon in 1913 with its headquarters in San Francisco and a major base in Vancouver**, was a secular, anti-British movement led by Punjabi immigrants. Its newspaper, *Ghadar* (“Revolt”), circulated among BC lumber and railway workers, advocating armed revolution in India—an ethical stance of transnational solidarity against Empire.

Concurrently, community institutions like the **Khalsa Diwan Society (established in Vancouver, 1906)** and the founding of the **first gurdwara in North America (1908)** provided spiritual sustenance and fought legal battles against exclusion. This dual tradition—radical political critique and resilient community building—defined early South Asian Canadian ethics.

The **Air India Flight 182 bombing on June 23, 1985**, which killed **329 people, 268 of them Canadian citizens**, stands as the largest mass murder in Canadian history. The **ethical failure of the Canadian state** was multifaceted: RCMP and CSIS intelligence failures prior to the attack; a **botched investigation** that allowed key evidence to be destroyed; and the pervasive framing of the tragedy as a “foreign” or “Indian” problem, denying the Canadianness of the predominantly Indo-Canadian victims. The subsequent **Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 (Major Commission, 2006-2010)** concluded it was a **“Canadian tragedy”** born of “institutional failings” and a “cascading series of errors.” This failure to see Sikh and Indo-Canadians as full members of the polity revealed a persistent ethical blind spot.

### 6. Contemporary Contradictions: The Model Minority, Temporary Labor & Political Voice
The **“model minority” myth**, while often presented as positive, functions as an **ethical trap** in the Canadian context. It homogenizes diverse Asian communities, erases poverty and marginalization, and is weaponized to undermine other racialized groups and justify neoliberal neglect. As scholar **Enakshi Dua** (“Beyond Diversity,” 2000) argues, Canadian multiculturalism often celebrates “ethnicity” while leaving white supremacy and colonial structures intact.

Contemporary immigration programs continue ethical dilemmas of expendability. The **Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP)**—a program with roots in the 1992 reforms—brought predominantly **Filipina women** to Canada under conditions scholar **Lisa Mar** describes as **“indentured care.”** They faced isolation, vulnerability to abuse, and family separation for years before potentially gaining permanent residence, a system that traded their labor for a conditional chance at belonging. Similarly, the **exploitative “international student pipeline”** sees students from India and other Asian countries paying exorbitant tuition for often substandard education while being funneled into precarious work, a dynamic laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet, **Asian Canadian political participation** has grown significantly, from the election of **Douglas Jung (PC) as the first Chinese Canadian MP in 1957** to substantial representation today. The ethical challenge of representation, as historian **Henry Yu** (*Thinking Orientals*, 2001) notes, is to move beyond tokenism toward transforming the structures that created racial hierarchy.

### Conclusion: An Unfinished Ethical Reckoning
The Asian Canadian ethical tradition is a narrative of **contradiction**: between Canada’s reliance on Asian labor and its commitment to a “white Canada”; between formal apologies and ongoing structural inequity; between multicultural celebration and persistent marginalization. It is a tradition built on **community solidarity (sangat), familial obligation, legal resistance, and the relentless demand for redress**—a demand that has forced Canada to confront the racial violence at its own foundations. The work remains unfinished, as each new chapter—from the Head Tax apology to the Air India Inquiry—reveals both the capacity for moral repair and the depth of the original ethical breach.

## Asian Canadian Ethical Traditions: From Exclusion to Redress

The history of Asian Canadians is a complex tapestry woven with threads of immense contribution, systemic exclusion, and a persistent struggle for recognition and justice. Ethical frameworks, both imposed upon and generated from within these communities, illuminate the profound moral challenges that have shaped Canada. This section traces the arc of this history, highlighting key moments of ethical reckoning and resilience.

### 1. Chinese Railway Workers (1881-1885): Expendable Labour and Sojourner Ethics

The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) stands as a testament to both nation-building and the brutal exploitation of Chinese labour. Between 15,000 and 17,000 Chinese workers toiled under perilous conditions, facing disease, accidents, and meager wages. An estimated 600 to 2,200 perished ( mortality estimates vary, but all indicate significant loss of life ). This grim calculus – prioritizing national infrastructure over the lives of racialized labourers – reveals a deeply flawed ethical foundation.

The dominant Canadian ethical framework of the time prioritized economic development and national unity above the well-being of Chinese workers. Sir John A. Macdonald's government actively recruited Chinese labourers because they were willing to work for lower wages than white labourers, thereby reducing construction costs ( *House of Commons Debates*, 1882-1885 ). This decision, while economically expedient, was ethically bankrupt, as it devalued Chinese lives and perpetuated racist hierarchies.

However, the Chinese workers did not arrive as blank slates. They brought their own ethical frameworks, deeply rooted in Confucian values of filial piety and obligation to family. Remittances sent home were a tangible expression of this ethical commitment, even amidst hardship and discrimination. Many Chinese immigrants adhered to a "sojourner" ethic, viewing their time in Canada as temporary, focused on accumulating wealth to improve their families' lives back in China. This orientation shaped their interactions with Canadian society, often leading them to endure harsh treatment with a pragmatic focus on their long-term goals. As historian Henry Yu has documented, the familial and clan associations were critical in providing support networks and mediating relations with the wider Canadian society (Yu, *Thinking Orientals*, 2001).

### 2. The Chinese Head Tax and Exclusion Act: A Nation Built on Exclusion

The completion of the CPR marked a turning point. With the railway finished, the need for Chinese labour diminished, and anti-Chinese sentiment surged. This culminated in the imposition of a head tax in 1885, levied on every Chinese person entering Canada. The initial tax of $50 was progressively increased, reaching $500 by 1903 ( *Chinese Immigration Act, 1885* ). This exorbitant sum was intended to deter Chinese immigration, reflecting a shift from exploitation to outright exclusion.

The ethical hypocrisy is glaring. Canada had relied on Chinese labour to build its infrastructure, yet now sought to deny Chinese people the right to live and work in the country. This betrayal reveals a deep-seated racism that permeated Canadian society and policy. The head tax created immense financial hardship for Chinese families, forcing many into debt and delaying family reunification.

The *Chinese Immigration Act of 1923* (also known as the Exclusion Act) took this discrimination to its most extreme form, effectively banning Chinese immigration to Canada. This legislation, enacted on Dominion Day (July 1st), became known as "Humiliation Day" within the Chinese community, marking a period of intense hardship and isolation ( *Chinese Immigration Act, 1923* ). For nearly a quarter-century, Chinese Canadians were denied basic rights and faced systemic discrimination in employment, housing, and social life.

The redress movement, led by organizations like the Chinese Canadian National Council, emerged to demand an apology and compensation for the head tax and Exclusion Act. After years of tireless advocacy, Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized in 2006 and offered symbolic individual payments of $20,000 to surviving payers (or their spouses). While the apology was a significant step, some argued that the compensation was inadequate, given the immense suffering and economic losses endured by the Chinese community ( *House of Commons Debates*, June 22, 2006 ).

### 3. The Komagata Maru Incident (1914): Race-Neutral Racism

The *Komagata Maru* incident exposed the insidious nature of Canadian immigration policies designed to exclude South Asian immigrants, particularly Sikhs. In 1914, the Japanese steamship Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver carrying 376 passengers, mostly Sikh men from British India. Despite being British subjects, they were denied entry under the "continuous journey" regulation, which stipulated that immigrants must arrive via a direct passage from their country of origin – an impossible condition for most Indians at the time.

This seemingly race-neutral regulation was, in effect, a thinly veiled attempt to exclude South Asians. The Canadian government, under Prime Minister Robert Borden, was determined to maintain a "white Canada" and actively sought to restrict immigration from Asia ( Hugh Johnston, *The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: The Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar*, 1989 ).

The passengers of the *Komagata Maru* were confined to the ship for two months, denied food and water, while their legal challenge was dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal ( *In re Komagata Maru*, 1914 ). Eventually, the ship was forced to return to India, where upon arrival in Budge Budge, British troops opened fire on the passengers, killing several and wounding many more.

The *Komagata Maru* incident became a symbol of racial injustice and a rallying cry for the South Asian community in Canada. It also fueled anti-colonial sentiments in India. While British Columbia apologized in 2008, it was not until 2016 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a formal apology on behalf of the Canadian government ( *House of Commons Debates*, May 18, 2016 ). The apology acknowledged the discriminatory laws and policies that led to the tragedy, but the scars of the incident remain.

### 4. Japanese Canadian Internment (1942-1949): Ethical Testimony in "Obasan"

The internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II represents one of the most egregious violations of civil liberties in Canadian history. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Canadian government, under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, invoked the *War Measures Act* to forcibly remove over 22,000 people of Japanese descent from their homes on the west coast. They were interned in camps in the interior of British Columbia, stripped of their property, and denied basic freedoms ( *Orders in Council P.C. 1486 and P.C. 1487*, 1942 ).

The rationale for internment was based on unfounded fears of espionage and sabotage, fueled by wartime hysteria and racist prejudice. No evidence of disloyalty was ever found against Japanese Canadians, yet they were treated as enemy aliens, regardless of their citizenship or length of residency. Their homes, businesses, and possessions were confiscated and sold at a fraction of their value, resulting in immense financial losses.

After the war, the government implemented a dispersal policy, forcing Japanese Canadians to choose between moving east of the Rockies or "repatriating" to Japan, even if they were born in Canada. This policy aimed to break up the Japanese Canadian community and prevent them from returning to their homes on the west coast.

The National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC) led the redress movement, demanding an apology, compensation, and acknowledgement of the injustices suffered during internment. In 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney issued a formal apology and offered individual payments of $21,000 to survivors. The apology acknowledged the violation of human rights and the lasting harm caused by the internment ( *Japanese Canadian Redress Agreement*, 1988 ).

Joy Kogawa's novel *Obasan* (1981) stands as a powerful ethical testimony to the internment experience. Through the eyes of Naomi Nakane, Kogawa explores the trauma of internment, the loss of identity, and the enduring silence that shrouded this dark chapter in Canadian history. *Obasan* is a crucial work of Canadian literature that compels readers to confront the ethical implications of racism and state-sponsored injustice.

### 5. South Asian Canadian Traditions: Anti-Colonialism and the Air India Tragedy

South Asian Canadians have a rich history of political activism and community building. The Ghadar Party, founded in British Columbia and Oregon in 1913, was an anti-colonial movement that sought to liberate India from British rule. The party drew support from Sikh communities in North America and played a significant role in shaping Indian nationalist sentiment ( Hugh Johnston, *The Four Quarters of the Night: The Life-Journey of an Emigrant Sikh*, 1995 ).

The Khalsa Diwan Society, established in Vancouver in the early 20th century, played a vital role in establishing Sikh institutions and preserving Sikh culture in Canada. Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) became centers of community life, providing religious, social, and educational services.

The Air India bombing in 1985 remains the largest mass murder in Canadian history, claiming the lives of 329 people, most of whom were Canadian citizens. The bombing was a terrorist act carried out by Sikh extremists seeking revenge for the Indian government's raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984.

The investigation into the Air India bombing was marred by errors and delays, leading to accusations of incompetence and indifference. The Canadian government's initial response was criticized for treating the tragedy as "an Indian problem" rather than a Canadian one, reflecting a broader tendency to marginalize South Asian concerns. The Air India Inquiry, led by Justice John Major, concluded in 2010 that a "cascading series of errors" by the Canadian government and security agencies contributed to the tragedy ( *Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182*, 2010 ).

The Air India bombing serves as a stark reminder of the ethical obligations of the state to protect all its citizens and to ensure that tragedies are investigated thoroughly and impartially. The failure to do so in the case of Air India has had a lasting impact on the South Asian community in Canada.

### 6. Contemporary Issues: Model Minority Myth and Exploitation of Caregivers

In contemporary Canada, Asian Canadians continue to face both opportunities and challenges. The "model minority" myth, which portrays Asian Canadians as uniformly successful and hardworking, can mask the realities of discrimination and inequality. This stereotype can also create divisions within the Asian Canadian community, as it ignores the diverse experiences and socio-economic backgrounds of its members.

The Live-in Caregiver Program, designed to provide a pathway to immigration for foreign caregivers, has been criticized for its potential for exploitation. Filipino caregivers, in particular, have been vulnerable to low wages, long hours, and precarious working conditions. The program's structure, which ties immigration status to employment, can create a power imbalance that makes it difficult for caregivers to assert their rights. Despite recent reforms, ethical concerns about the program persist.

The increasing number of international students from Asia attending Canadian universities presents another set of ethical considerations. While international students contribute significantly to the Canadian economy and enrich campus life, they also face challenges such as high tuition fees, language barriers, and cultural adjustment. There are concerns about the recruitment practices of some institutions, which may prioritize revenue over the well-being of students.

The rise of Asian Canadian political participation is a positive development, but it also raises complex questions about representation and identity. Asian Canadian politicians face the challenge of representing both their ethnic communities and the broader Canadian electorate. The ethics of representation require them to balance these competing interests and to advocate for policies that promote equality and justice for all.

### 7. Key Scholars

The study of Asian Canadian history and ethics has been enriched by the work of numerous scholars. Henry Yu's work on the Chinese Canadian experience, including *Thinking Orientals: Migration, Contact, and Exoticism in Modern America* (2001), provides valuable insights into the social and cultural dynamics of early Chinese communities in North America. Mona Oikawa's scholarship explores the internment of Japanese Canadians and its lasting impact on identity and memory. Lisa Mar's research examines the history of Chinese women in Canada, highlighting their contributions and struggles. Nayan Shah's work focuses on the history of South Asian migration to North America, with particular attention to issues of race, gender, and sexuality. Enakshi Dua's scholarship addresses issues of racism, immigration, and social justice in Canada.

In conclusion, the history of Asian Canadians is a complex and multifaceted story marked by both profound injustices and remarkable resilience. Ethical frameworks, both imposed and generated from within these communities, provide a lens through which to understand the challenges and triumphs of Asian Canadians in their ongoing struggle for equality and justice. The journey from exclusion to redress is far from over, but the voices and experiences of Asian Canadians are increasingly being heard and recognized in the Canadian narrative.

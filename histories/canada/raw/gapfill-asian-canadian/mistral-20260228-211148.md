### **Asian Canadian Ethical Traditions: From Exclusion to Redress**

The ethical traditions of Asian Canadians are rooted in a history of racialized labor, exclusion, resistance, and eventual (though incomplete) redress. These traditions emerge from the tension between Canada’s nation-building projects—often predicated on the expendability of racialized bodies—and the ethical frameworks of Asian migrants themselves, including Confucian obligations, Sikh *seva* (selfless service), and anti-colonial resistance. This history is marked by state violence, legal exclusion, and community resilience, with ethical debates centering on labor exploitation, citizenship, belonging, and the limits of liberal multiculturalism.

### **1. Chinese Railway Workers: Nation-Building Through Expendable Labor (1881–1885)**
Between 1881 and 1885, **15,000–17,000 Chinese laborers** were recruited to build the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), primarily in British Columbia. Working in dangerous conditions—blasting through the Rocky Mountains, enduring avalanches, and facing malnutrition—an estimated **600–2,200 Chinese workers died** (historian **Peter Ward** estimates at least 600; others suggest up to 4,000 when including long-term injuries and disappearances). They were paid **$1.00 per day** (half the wage of white workers) and forced to cover their own food and lodging, while white workers received free board.

#### **The Ethical Calculus: Racial Capitalism and Confucian Obligation**
The Canadian state and CPR executives justified this exploitation through a **utilitarian racial calculus**: Chinese labor was necessary for national development, but Chinese people themselves were deemed unassimilable. As **Prime Minister John A. Macdonald** stated in the **House of Commons (1882)**:
> *"It is simply a question of alternatives: either you must have this labour or you cannot have the railway."*

For Chinese workers, however, the ethical framework was one of **sojourner ethics**—a temporary migration to support families in Guangdong through remittances. Many operated within a **Confucian moral economy**, where filial piety (*xiao*) and collective survival outweighed individual risk. Historian **Henry Yu** (*Thinking Orientals: Migration, Contact, and Exoticism in Modern America*, 2001) argues that Chinese migrants saw themselves as **"paper sons"**—not permanent settlers but transnational laborers whose primary loyalty remained to their ancestral villages.

Yet this sojourner identity was weaponized against them. The **Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration (1885)** concluded that Chinese workers were **"unfit for full citizenship"** due to their supposed inability to assimilate, justifying their exclusion even as their labor was indispensable.

### **2. The Chinese Head Tax and Exclusion Act: The Ethics of a Nation Built by Excluded Labor (1885–1947)**
In response to anti-Chinese sentiment—fueled by economic depression and white labor unions—the Canadian government imposed a **$50 head tax** in **1885** (under the *Chinese Immigration Act, 1885*), the first race-based immigration law in Canada. The tax was raised to **$100 in 1900** and **$500 in 1903** (equivalent to **$15,000 today**), effectively barring working-class Chinese migrants. Between **1885 and 1923**, Canada collected **$23 million** (over **$500 million today**) from approximately **82,000 Chinese migrants**.

The **Chinese Immigration Act, 1923** (the **"Chinese Exclusion Act"**) banned Chinese immigration entirely, with exceptions for merchants, diplomats, and students. The law remained in effect until **1947**, despite Canada’s wartime alliance with China against Japan.

#### **The Redress Movement and Harper’s Apology (2006)**
The **Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC)** led the redress campaign, framing the head tax as a **moral debt** owed to families who had paid the tax and to those who had died in railway construction. After decades of activism, **Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology in 2006**, accompanied by **$20,000 individual payments** to surviving head tax payers (or their spouses). However, the redress was **limited**: only **785 survivors** received compensation, and the families of those who had died in railway construction were excluded.

Ethically, the redress debate centered on **restorative vs. distributive justice**. Critics, including historian **Lisa Mar** (*Brokering Belonging: Chinese in Canada’s Exclusion Era, 1885–1945*, 2010), argued that the apology and payments were **symbolic rather than transformative**, failing to address systemic anti-Chinese racism in immigration policy.

### **3. The Komagata Maru Incident (1914): The Ethics of "Continuous Journey" as Race-Neutral Racism**
In **May 1914**, the **Komagata Maru**, a Japanese steamship carrying **376 passengers (340 Sikhs, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus)**, arrived in Vancouver’s harbor. The passengers, mostly **British subjects from Punjab**, were denied entry under the **"continuous journey" regulation** (*Immigration Act, 1906*), which required migrants to travel directly from their country of origin—a rule designed to exclude South Asians, who could not make the journey without stopping.

The ship was **detained for two months** while legal challenges were mounted. The **Supreme Court of British Columbia (1914)** ruled against the passengers, and the **Canadian military** forced the ship to return to India. Upon arrival in **Budge Budge (Calcutta)**, British troops fired on the passengers, killing **20**.

#### **Legal and Ethical Frameworks: British Subjecthood vs. White Canada**
The Komagata Maru incident exposed the **hypocrisy of British subjecthood**—South Asians were technically equal under the Crown, but Canada’s immigration laws treated them as racial outsiders. Historian **Nayan Shah** (*Stranger Intimacy: Contesting Race, Sexuality and the Law in the North American West*, 2011) argues that the **"continuous journey" rule was a form of "race-neutral racism"**—a bureaucratic mechanism that achieved racial exclusion without explicit racial language.

The **Khalsa Diwan Society**, a Sikh organization founded in **Vancouver (1907)**, led legal challenges and community resistance. The incident became a **symbol of anti-colonial solidarity**, influencing the **Ghadar Party** (see below).

In **2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a formal apology** in the House of Commons, acknowledging Canada’s role in the tragedy. However, the apology was criticized for **failing to address ongoing systemic racism** in immigration policy.

### **4. Japanese Canadian Internment (1942–1949): The Ethics of Dispossession and Redress**
Following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor (**December 1941**), the Canadian government, under **Prime Minister Mackenzie King**, invoked the **War Measures Act (1914)** to **uproot 22,000 Japanese Canadians**—75% of whom were **Canadian citizens**. They were sent to **internment camps in British Columbia’s interior**, road camps, or sugar beet farms in Alberta and Manitoba. Their property—homes, businesses, and fishing boats—was **confiscated and sold without consent** under the **Custodian of Enemy Property** program.

After the war, Japanese Canadians were given a **choice**: move **east of the Rockies** or be **"repatriated" to Japan** (even if born in Canada). Approximately **4,000 were deported** before public outcry halted the policy.

#### **The Redress Movement and *Obasan* as Ethical Testimony**
The **National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC)**, led by **Art Miki**, campaigned for redress, framing internment as a **violation of liberal democratic principles**. In **1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney issued a formal apology** and provided **$21,000 in individual compensation**, along with **$12 million for a community fund** and **$24 million for a Canadian Race Relations Foundation**.

Writer **Joy Kogawa’s *Obasan* (1981)**—a semi-autobiographical novel about a Japanese Canadian girl’s experience of internment—became a **key ethical text**, forcing Canadians to confront the **erasure of racial violence** under the myth of "polite Canada." Historian **Mona Oikawa** (*Cartographies of Violence: Japanese Canadian Women, Memory, and the Subjects of the Internment*, 2012) argues that the redress movement succeeded in part because it **framed internment as a betrayal of liberal citizenship**, rather than as a wartime necessity.

However, the redress was **incomplete**: the **$21,000 payments** were far below the **$443 million** (adjusted for inflation) that Japanese Canadians lost in property seizures. Moreover, the apology did not address **ongoing anti-Asian racism**, as seen in the **COVID-19 pandemic** (e.g., the **2021 Atlanta spa shootings** and rising anti-Asian hate crimes in Canada).

### **5. South Asian Canadian Traditions: Anti-Colonialism, Institutional Resistance, and the Air India Bombing**
#### **The Ghadar Party (1913–1919): Anti-Colonial Ethics in British Columbia**
Founded in **1913 in Astoria, Oregon, and Vancouver**, the **Ghadar Party** was a **revolutionary anti-colonial movement** led by Punjabi Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims. Its newspaper, *The Ghadar*, published in **Urdu, Punjabi, and English**, called for the **overthrow of British rule in India**. The party’s **Vancouver headquarters** became a hub for **transnational anti-imperialism**, with members including **Bhagwan Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha, and Taraknath Das**.

The **Komagata Maru incident (1914)** radicalized the Ghadar movement, leading to **armed uprisings in Punjab (1915)**. The British Empire **executed or imprisoned** many Ghadar leaders, but the party’s legacy endured in **Sikh diasporic politics**, including the **Khalistan movement**.

#### **The Khalsa Diwan Society and Sikh Institution-Building**
The **Khalsa Diwan Society (KDS)**, founded in **Vancouver (1907)**, became a **cornerstone of Sikh ethical life**, providing **gurdwaras (temples), schools, and mutual aid networks**. The **Ross Street Temple (1970)** in Vancouver remains a **symbol of Sikh resilience**, despite **racist opposition** (e.g., the **1907 anti-Asian riots** in Vancouver).

#### **The Air India Bombing (1985): Canada’s Largest Mass Murder and the Ethics of Neglect**
On **June 23, 1985**, **Air India Flight 182** was bombed mid-flight, killing **329 people**—mostly **Canadian citizens of Indian descent**. The attack was linked to **Sikh militants** seeking revenge for the **Indian Army’s 1984 assault on the Golden Temple (Operation Blue Star)**.

The **Canadian government’s response was a disaster**:
- The **RCMP and CSIS** had **prior intelligence** but failed to act.
- The **investigation was botched**, with key evidence lost or mishandled.
- The **trial of suspects (2003–2005)** ended in **acquittals**, leaving no one convicted.

The bombing was **framed as "an Indian problem"** rather than a **Canadian tragedy**, reflecting the **racialized hierarchy of mourning** in Canada. As scholar **Sherene Razack** (*Dark Threats and White Knights: The Somalia Affair, Peacekeeping, and the New Imperialism*, 2004) argues, the **failure to properly investigate Air India** revealed how **brown and Black lives are devalued in Canadian public memory**.

In **2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper** acknowledged the bombing as a **"Canadian tragedy"**, but no **formal apology or comprehensive inquiry** has been issued.

### **6. Contemporary Ethical Crises: Model Minorities, Caregiver Exploitation, and the Politics of Representation**
#### **The "Model Minority" Myth in Canada**
The **model minority myth**—the stereotype that Asian Canadians are **hardworking, docile, and economically successful**—has been **weaponized to pit racialized groups against each other**. This narrative **erases intra-Asian disparities** (e.g., **Southeast Asian refugees vs. East Asian professionals**) and **justifies anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism**.

Scholar **Enakshi Dua** (*Beyond Borders: A Partial History of Canada*, 2005) argues that the **model minority myth is a tool of white supremacy**, designed to **undermine collective racial justice movements**.

#### **Filipino Caregivers and the Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP): Labor Exploitation as Immigration Policy**
The **Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP)**, established in **1992**, allowed **Filipino women** to work in Canada as **domestic caregivers** in exchange for **permanent residency after two years**. However, the program was **exploitative by design**:
- Caregivers were **tied to a single employer**, making them vulnerable to **abuse and wage theft**.
- Many worked **60–80 hours per week** for **below minimum wage**.
- The **two-year requirement** was often extended due to **bureaucratic delays**, leaving workers in **precarious legal limbo**.

In **2014, the LCP was replaced with the **Caregiver Program**, but **exploitation persists** under the **Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP)**. The **ethical crisis** lies in Canada’s **dependence on racialized migrant labor** while denying these workers **full citizenship rights**.

#### **International Students and the "Cash Cow" Pipeline**
Canada has become the **top destination for international students**, with **over 800,000 in 2023** (a **31% increase since 2019**). **Indian students** make up the **largest group (40%)**, followed by **Chinese students (12%)**. However, the system is **ethically fraught**:
- **Exorbitant tuition fees** (up to **$50,000/year**) turn students into **revenue streams** for universities.
- **Housing exploitation**—many students live in **overcrowded, unsafe conditions** due to **lack of regulation**.
- **Precarious immigration pathways**—students are often **funneled into low-wage jobs** under the **Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)**, with **no guarantee of permanent residency**.

The **2023 cap on international student visas** (a **35% reduction**) was framed as a **solution to housing shortages**, but critics argue it **scapegoats students** rather than addressing **corporate greed in education and real estate**.

#### **The Ethics of Asian Canadian Political Representation**
Asian Canadians are **underrepresented in politics**, despite being **20% of the population**. Key milestones include:
- **Douglas Jung (1957)**: First Chinese Canadian MP (Conservative).
- **Herb Dhaliwal (1993)**: First South Asian cabinet minister (Liberal).
- **Vivienne Poy (1998)**: First Chinese Canadian senator.
- **Anita Anand (2019)**: First Hindu cabinet minister (Liberal).

However, **representation does not equal power**. As scholar **Sunera Thobani** (*Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada*, 2007) argues, **racialized politicians are often tokenized**, expected to **uphold the status quo** rather than challenge systemic racism.

### **7. Key Scholars and Ethical Frameworks**
The study of Asian Canadian ethical traditions is shaped by **critical race scholars** who challenge **liberal multiculturalism** and **settler colonial narratives**. Key thinkers include:
- **Henry Yu** (*Thinking Orientals*, 2001): Examines **Chinese sojourner ethics** and the **racialization of labor**.
- **Mona Oikawa** (*Cartographies of Violence*, 2012): Analyzes **Japanese Canadian internment** through a **feminist, anti-colonial lens**.
- **Lisa Mar** (*Brokering Belonging*, 2010): Studies **Chinese exclusion-era resistance** and **transnational family networks**.
- **Nayan Shah** (*Stranger Intimacy*, 2011): Explores **South Asian migration** and **race-neutral racism**.
- **Enakshi Dua** (*Beyond Borders*, 2005): Critiques the **model minority myth** and **Canadian multiculturalism**.

### **Conclusion: The Unfinished Ethics of Redress**
The Asian Canadian ethical tradition is one of **resistance to racial capitalism, state violence, and liberal hypocrisy**. From **Chinese railway workers** to **Japanese internment survivors** to **Filipino caregivers**, Asian Canadians have **navigated exploitation while building institutions of care and solidarity**.

Yet **redress remains incomplete**:
- **No apology or compensation** for **Chinese railway workers’ families**.
- **No comprehensive inquiry** into the **Air India bombing**.
- **Ongoing exploitation** of **migrant workers and international students**.
- **The persistence of the model minority myth**, which **erases anti-Asian racism** while **undermining Black and Indigenous struggles**.

The **ethical challenge** for Canada is not just **apologies and payments**, but **structural transformation**—dismantling the **racialized labor systems** that continue to exploit Asian migrants while denying them **full citizenship and belonging**. As **Joy Kogawa** writes in *Obasan*:
> *"The past is the future. The future is the past. It all circles around."*

The question is whether Canada will **break the cycle** or continue to **reproduce it**.

### **The Acadian Ethical Tradition and the Deportation as Foundational Ethical Catastrophe**

The Acadian experience in what is now Canada’s Maritime provinces represents one of the most profound ethical traditions—and ethical catastrophes—in North American history. Over 150 years, Acadians developed a distinct society rooted in communal labor, ecological stewardship, and a principled neutrality that set them apart from both French and British colonial projects. The **Deportation (1755–1764)**, however, was a rupture so violent that it reshaped Acadian identity forever, scattering survivors across the Atlantic world while leaving an enduring moral wound in Canadian history. This entry traces the ethical foundations of Acadian society, the mechanics of its destruction, the diasporic resilience of its people, and the ongoing reckoning with this foundational injustice.

### **1. Acadian Society Before 1755: Land, Labor, and Neutrality as Ethical Foundations**

#### **The Founding of Port-Royal (1605) and the Emergence of a Distinct Society**
The Acadian story begins with **Pierre Dugua de Mons’ establishment of Port-Royal in 1605**, making it one of the earliest permanent European settlements in North America. Unlike the seigneurial system of New France, where land was hierarchically controlled, Acadian society developed along more egalitarian lines. By the early 18th century, Acadians had forged a **distinct identity**—linguistically (a French dialect with Mi’kmaq loanwords), religiously (Catholic but with syncretic practices), and economically (small-scale farming rather than the fur trade).

#### **The Aboiteau System: Communal Labor and Ecological Stewardship**
The most striking ethical innovation of Acadian society was its **dyke (aboiteau) system**, an engineering marvel that allowed them to reclaim **salt marshes** for agriculture. This was not merely a technical achievement but a **communal labor ethic**:
- **Collective maintenance**: Dykes required constant upkeep, and entire villages would work together in **corvées** (unpaid communal labor).
- **Sustainable land use**: Unlike British settlers, who often exhausted soil through monoculture, Acadians practiced **rotational farming** and **livestock grazing** that preserved the land.
- **Ecological adaptation**: The aboiteaux (wooden sluice gates) allowed fresh water to irrigate fields while preventing saltwater intrusion—a model of **adaptive stewardship** in a challenging environment.

This system was not just practical but **ethically significant**: it embodied a **rejection of extractive colonialism** in favor of a **reciprocal relationship with the land**. As historian **Naomi Griffiths** argues in *The Contexts of Acadian History, 1686–1784* (1992), the aboiteaux were "a symbol of Acadian independence and self-sufficiency" (p. 45).

#### **Neutrality as Ethical Resistance**
Acadia’s position between French and British empires forced Acadians into a **delicate ethical stance: neutrality**. After the **Treaty of Utrecht (1713)**, Britain gained control of Acadia (renamed **Nova Scotia**), but Acadians refused to swear an **unconditional oath of allegiance** to the British Crown. Instead, they offered a **conditional oath**—promising not to take up arms against either empire but retaining their Catholic faith and land rights.

This neutrality was **not passive submission** but an **active ethical choice**:
- **Refusal of militarization**: Unlike British settlers, Acadians did not form militias, avoiding entanglement in imperial wars.
- **Diplomatic balancing**: They maintained trade relations with both the British at **Annapolis Royal** and the French at **Louisbourg**, demonstrating a **pragmatic non-alignment**.
- **Moral autonomy**: Their neutrality was rooted in a **Catholic pacifist tradition**, reinforced by their **Mi’kmaq allies**, who also resisted British encroachment.

British officials, however, saw this neutrality as **treasonous ambiguity**. As **Governor Richard Philipps** complained in 1720:
> *"They are neither subjects nor allies, but a people apart, neither fish nor fowl."* (Cited in Griffiths, p. 78)

This refusal to fully assimilate into the British colonial order would later be **cited as justification for their expulsion**.

#### **Acadian-Mi’kmaq Relations: A Cross-Cultural Ethical Alliance**
Unlike many settler-Indigenous relations in Canada, **Acadian-Mi’kmaq relations were marked by interdependence and mutual respect**. Key aspects included:
- **Intermarriage**: By the 18th century, many Acadian families had Mi’kmaq ancestry (e.g., the **Melanson, Comeau, and LeBlanc** families).
- **Shared resistance**: When British forces attempted to impose control, Acadians and Mi’kmaq **jointly resisted**, most notably in the **1720s and 1740s**.
- **Land ethics**: The Mi’kmaq concept of **netukulimk** (sustainable resource use) aligned with Acadian agricultural practices, creating a **shared ecological ethic**.

This alliance was **not without tension**—some Acadians participated in the fur trade, which disrupted Mi’kmaq hunting grounds—but it remained **far more collaborative than most settler-Indigenous dynamics in Canada**. As **Mi’kmaq historian Daniel Paul** notes in *We Were Not the Savages* (1993), the Acadian-Mi’kmaq relationship was "one of the few examples in colonial North America where two peoples managed to coexist without large-scale violence" (p. 89).

### **2. The Deportation (1755–1764): Mechanics of an Ethical Catastrophe**

#### **The Decision: Colonel Charles Lawrence’s Order (1755)**
The **Deportation (Le Grand Dérangement)** was not an impulsive act but a **calculated policy of ethnic cleansing**. The key document is **Colonel Charles Lawrence’s Order of July 31, 1755**, issued after the **Fall of Fort Beauséjour** (June 1755) and the **Acadian refusal to swear an unconditional oath** to Britain.

Lawrence’s order stated:
> *"His Majesty’s Council… have unanimously agreed that it is absolutely necessary that the French Inhabitants of this Province be removed… and that their Lands and Tenements, Cattle of all Kinds, and Live Stock of all Sorts be forfeited to the Crown."* (Cited in Faragher, *A Great and Noble Scheme*, 2005, p. 289)

This was **not a military necessity** but a **preemptive strike** to eliminate a perceived fifth column. As **John Mack Faragher** argues, the Deportation was "the first modern instance of **state-sponsored ethnic cleansing** in North America" (p. 312).

#### **The Mechanics of Expulsion: Families Torn Apart, Homes Burned**
The Deportation was **systematic and brutal**:
- **Roundups**: British troops (often with **New England militias**) surrounded Acadian villages, giving families **minutes to gather belongings** before being marched to ships.
- **Separation of families**: Men, women, and children were **often loaded onto different ships**, leading to permanent separations. Some families were **never reunited**.
- **Destruction of property**: Homes, churches, and barns were **burned to the ground** to prevent return. Livestock was **confiscated or slaughtered**.
- **Overcrowded transports**: Ships were **grossly overcrowded**, with **no sanitation**. Mortality rates on some voyages reached **30–50%** (e.g., the **Duke William** and **Violet** sank in 1758, drowning hundreds).
- **Scattering**: Acadians were **dispersed across the Atlantic world**:
  - **Thirteen Colonies** (where many were **rejected as "French papists"** and re-deported).
  - **France** (where they were **settled in unproductive marshlands** and faced starvation).
  - **England** (where they were **held in prisons** before being sent to France).
  - **Caribbean** (where many died of **tropical diseases**).
  - **Louisiana** (where survivors would later become **Cajuns**).

#### **Resistance: The Pembroke Incident (1756)**
Not all Acadians went passively. The most famous act of resistance was the **Pembroke incident (1756)**, where a group of Acadians **seized control of the ship transporting them** and **sailed to present-day New Brunswick**, where they joined Mi’kmaq allies in the **Miramichi region**. This act of defiance became a **symbol of Acadian resilience** and is memorialized in **Antonine Maillet’s *Pélagie-la-Charrette*** (1979).

### **3. The Cajun Diaspora: Ethical Continuity in Exile**

#### **The Louisiana Migration (1765–1785)**
The **most enduring Acadian diaspora** was in **Louisiana**, where survivors arrived in **three waves (1765, 1766, 1785)**. The term **"Cajun"** (from *Acadien*) emerged as a **linguistic and cultural marker** of this transplanted identity.

#### **Ethical Continuities in Cajun Culture**
Despite the rupture of the Deportation, **three key Acadian ethical traditions persisted in Cajun culture**:
1. **Communal land use**: The **Cajun "long lot" system** (narrow, riverfront farms) mirrored Acadian land distribution, emphasizing **shared access to water and resources**.
2. **Catholic faith and linguistic resistance**: Cajuns maintained **French-language worship** and **festivals (e.g., Mardi Gras)** as acts of cultural survival.
3. **Adaptive stewardship**: Like their Acadian ancestors, Cajuns developed **sustainable fishing and trapping practices** in Louisiana’s bayous.

As **Carl Brasseaux** notes in *Acadian to Cajun* (1992), the Cajun experience was "not just a transplantation but a **recreation of Acadian ethics in a new environment**" (p. 124).

### **4. The Return and Rebuilding: The Acadian Renaissance**

#### **The Return to the Maritimes (Post-1764)**
After the **Treaty of Paris (1763)**, some Acadians **began trickling back** to the Maritimes, though they were **barred from their original lands** (now occupied by British settlers). They settled in **remote areas** like:
- **New Brunswick (Memramcook, Caraquet)**
- **Nova Scotia (Chéticamp, Isle Madame)**
- **Prince Edward Island (Rustico)**

#### **The Convention of 1881 (Memramcook): Reclaiming Identity**
The **first National Acadian Convention (1881, Memramcook, NB)** marked the **beginning of the Acadian Renaissance**. Key outcomes:
- **National symbols**:
  - **Flag**: The **tricolore with a gold star (Stella Maris)**, adopted in 1884.
  - **Anthem**: *"Ave Maris Stella"* (Hail, Star of the Sea).
  - **Feast Day**: **August 15 (Assumption of Mary)**, chosen in 1881.
- **Institutional revival**: The **Société Nationale de l’Assomption** (later **Société Nationale de l’Acadie**) was founded to **promote Acadian rights**.

#### **The Acadian Renaissance (1960s–1970s)**
The **Quiet Revolution’s** cultural nationalism inspired Acadians to **demand recognition**. Key developments:
- **Antonine Maillet’s *Pélagie-la-Charrette* (1979)**: This **Prix Goncourt-winning novel** retold the Deportation through the eyes of a **returning Acadian woman**, becoming a **foundational text of Acadian literature**.
- **University of Moncton (1963)**: The first **French-language university in the Maritimes**, it became a **hub of Acadian intellectual life**.
- **Official bilingualism (1969)**: The **Official Languages Act** recognized Acadian French as a **distinct linguistic minority**, though **implementation remains uneven**.

### **5. The Ethical Reckoning: Apologies, Commemoration, and Debate**

#### **Queen Elizabeth II’s Royal Proclamation (2003)**
On **December 10, 2003**, Queen Elizabeth II issued a **Royal Proclamation** acknowledging the Deportation:
> *"On behalf of all Canadians, I acknowledge the tragic events that occurred 250 years ago… The deportation of the Acadian people was a deep tragedy."*

However, the proclamation **stopped short of an apology**, and many Acadians **rejected it as insufficient**. As **Maurice Basque** argues in *Deportation, Migration, and Survival* (2004), "A proclamation is not justice. It does not return stolen land or compensate for generations of suffering" (p. 211).

#### **July 28 Commemoration: A Day of Mourning**
Since 2005, **July 28** (the date of Lawrence’s order) has been observed as **Acadian Remembrance Day**. Events include:
- **Candlelight vigils** in former Acadian villages.
- **Reenactments of the Deportation** (e.g., in **Grand-Pré, NS**, site of the **Grand-Pré National Historic Site**).
- **Calls for reparations**, including **land restitution** and **educational reforms**.

#### **Genocide or Ethnic Cleansing? The Debate Over Terminology**
Scholars and activists **disagree on how to classify the Deportation**:
- **Ethnic cleansing**: Most historians (e.g., Faragher, Griffiths) use this term, as the goal was **removal, not extermination**.
- **Genocide**: Some Acadian activists argue that the **intent to destroy Acadian society** (through dispersal, family separation, and cultural erasure) fits the **UN Genocide Convention’s definition** (1948).
- **Cultural genocide**: The **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC, 2015)** cited the Deportation as an example of **cultural genocide**, though it did not use the term for Acadians specifically.

The debate remains **unresolved**, but the **moral weight of the Deportation is undeniable**.

### **6. Acadian-Mi’kmaq Relations: A Model of Cross-Cultural Ethics?**

The Acadian-Mi’kmaq relationship **challenges the dominant narrative of settler-Indigenous conflict in Canada**. Key aspects:
- **Shared resistance**: Acadians and Mi’kmaq **fought together** in the **1720s and 1740s** against British expansion.
- **Intermarriage and kinship**: Many Acadian families (e.g., **Melanson, Comeau**) have **Mi’kmaq ancestry**, creating a **hybrid identity**.
- **Land ethics**: Both peoples practiced **sustainable resource use**, contrasting with British **extractive colonialism**.

However, the relationship was **not without tension**:
- Some Acadians **participated in the fur trade**, which **disrupted Mi’kmaq hunting grounds**.
- After the Deportation, **returning Acadians sometimes occupied Mi’kmaq lands**, leading to **new conflicts**.

Despite these complexities, the **Acadian-Mi’kmaq alliance remains one of the few examples in Canadian history of **settler-Indigenous collaboration rather than domination**.

### **Conclusion: The Deportation as a Foundational Ethical Catastrophe**

The **Deportation of the Acadians was not just a historical event but an ethical rupture**—one that **shattered a society built on communal labor, ecological stewardship, and principled neutrality**. Its legacy persists in:
- **The Cajun diaspora**, where Acadian ethics **survived in exile**.
- **The Acadian Renaissance**, where a **suppressed identity re-emerged**.
- **Ongoing debates** over **reparations, terminology (genocide vs. ethnic cleansing), and land justice**.

Unlike the **"polite Canada" narrative**, which often **minimizes colonial violence**, the Acadian story **forces a confrontation with the brutality of state-sponsored displacement**. It also **challenges simplistic settler-Indigenous binaries**, showing that **cross-cultural alliances were possible**—even if they were ultimately **undone by imperial violence**.

As **Antonine Maillet** writes in *Pélagie-la-Charrette*:
> *"We were not conquered. We were scattered. And from the scattering, we remade ourselves."*

The ethical question that remains is whether Canada will **reckon with this scattering**—not just in **proclamations and commemorations**, but in **justice**.

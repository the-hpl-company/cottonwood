### Acadian Ethical Traditions and the Deportation: A Foundational Catastrophe in Canadian History

The story of the Acadians in Canada is one of resilience, distinct ethical traditions, and profound suffering. From their early settlement to the trauma of the Deportation and their eventual return, the Acadians developed a unique cultural and ethical identity rooted in communal labor, neutrality, and cross-cultural alliances. However, the Deportation of 1755-1764 remains a foundational ethical catastrophe in Canadian history, marking a violent rupture in Acadian society and raising ongoing questions about justice, memory, and reconciliation.

#### 1. Acadian Society Before 1755: A Distinct Ethical Identity

The Acadians established their first permanent settlement at Port-Royal in 1605, developing a distinct society over 150 years. Central to their ethical tradition was the **dyke (aboiteau) system**, an engineering feat that reclaimed fertile land from the sea. This communal labor required cooperation and mutual aid, fostering an ethic of collective responsibility. As historian Naomi Griffiths notes in *The Contexts of Acadian History* (1992), the aboiteau system "symbolized the Acadian commitment to resilience and interdependence."

Acadians also practiced **ethical neutrality** in the colonial conflicts between Britain and France. They refused to swear unconditional allegiance to the British Crown under the 1730 oath of allegiance, which would have required them to take up arms against France. Instead, they sought a **middle path**, offering a conditional oath that allowed them to maintain their lands and neutrality. This stance reflected a pragmatic ethic of survival in a colonial context, though it ultimately made them vulnerable to British suspicion.

#### 2. The Deportation (1755-1764): A Violent Rupture

In 1755, British Colonel Charles Lawrence ordered the expulsion of approximately 11,500 Acadians, beginning what is known as **Le Grand Dérangement**. The mechanics of the Deportation were devastating: families were separated, homes burned, and livestock confiscated. Deportees were scattered to the Thirteen Colonies, France, England, and the Caribbean, with mortality rates during transport estimated at 30-50% in some shipments.

One of the most dramatic moments of resistance occurred in the **Pembroke incident**, where Acadians seized control of the ship deporting them. This act of defiance, while rare, underscores the agency and resilience of the Acadian people in the face of immense suffering. Historian John Mack Faragher, in *A Great and Noble Scheme* (2005), argues that the Deportation was "a deliberate act of ethnic cleansing" aimed at removing a perceived threat to British colonial ambitions.

#### 3. The Cajun Diaspora: Continuity in Louisiana

Between 1765 and 1785, some Acadians eventually settled in Louisiana, where they became known as **Cajuns**. Despite the transformation of their identity, they preserved key ethical traditions, including **communal land use** and **linguistic resistance** to assimilation. The persistence of the Acadian French language and Catholic faith in Louisiana reflects the enduring cultural resilience of the diaspora. Today, Cajun culture continues to honor its Acadian roots through festivals, music, and food, maintaining a connection to the ethics of interdependence and cultural preservation.

#### 4. Return and Rebuilding: The Acadian Renaissance

After the Treaty of Paris in 1763, some Acadians returned to the Maritimes, where they faced significant challenges in rebuilding their communities. The **Convention of 1881** in Memramcook marked a turning point, as Acadians gathered to assert their national identity, selecting symbols such as a flag, anthem, and feast day (August 15).

The **Acadian Renaissance** of the 1960s-70s saw a resurgence of cultural pride, exemplified by Antonine Maillet’s novel *Pélagie-la-Charrette* (1979), which won the Prix Goncourt. The establishment of the **University of Moncton** in 1963 further revitalized Acadian intellectual life, fostering a new generation of scholars and artists.

#### 5. Ethical Reckoning: Memory and Justice

In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II issued a **Royal Proclamation** acknowledging the Deportation but stopped short of apologizing. The July 28 commemoration of the Deportation remains a focal point for Acadian memory and identity. Debate persists over whether the Deportation constitutes **ethnic cleansing** or **genocide** under modern definitions. Maurice Basque, in his work on Acadian identity, argues that the trauma of the Deportation continues to shape Acadian collective memory and ethical claims for justice.

#### 6. Acadian-Mi’kmaq Relations: A Cross-Cultural Ethical Alliance

Acadians maintained a close alliance with the Mi’kmaq, marked by intermarriage and shared resistance to British rule. This cross-cultural relationship distinguishes Acadian-Indigenous dynamics from other settler-Indigenous interactions in Canada. Naomi Griffiths highlights the mutual respect and cooperation between Acadians and Mi’kmaq, which contrasts sharply with the often exploitative relationships seen elsewhere.

### Conclusion

The Acadian experience embodies both the ethical resilience of a community and the catastrophic violence of colonial ambition. The Deportation remains a defining moment in Canadian history, raising profound questions about justice, memory, and reconciliation. By examining Acadian traditions, alliances, and resistance, we gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of Canadian identity and the enduring legacy of colonial harm.

### **The Acadian Ethical Tradition and the Great Deportation: An Ethical Catastrophe in Canadian History**

The Acadian story is not a sidebar to Canadian history but a central, traumatic narrative that exposes the violent foundations of the Canadian state and the resilience of a distinct ethical community. It is a story of a people who, over 150 years, forged a unique identity grounded in communal labor, political neutrality, and cross-cultural alliance, only to be systematically destroyed in an act of calculated expulsion. The Deportation (*Le Grand Dérangement*) of 1755-1764 remains a foundational ethical catastrophe, a rupture whose legacy of diaspora, survival, and contested memory continues to shape Canada.

#### **1. The Formation of an Acadian Ethos (1605-1755)**
Founded at Port-Royal in 1605, Acadia developed a society distinct from both New France and the emerging British colonies. Its ethical core was shaped by two principal forces: the land and the geopolitics of empire.

*   **The Aboiteau System and Communal Ethics:** The Acadian relationship with the land was defined by the *aboiteau*—a complex sluice-gate system built into dykes to reclaim fertile marshland from the Bay of Fundy tides. This engineering feat demanded and reinforced a profound ethic of **communal labor and stewardship**. As historian Maurice Basque notes, the construction and maintenance of dykes required collective, coordinated effort, fostering a society oriented toward shared prosperity and interdependence rather than individual land accumulation. The land itself, won from the sea through communal work, became the material and symbolic foundation of Acadian identity.

*   **The Ethics of Neutrality:** Geopolitically, Acadians found themselves on the contested frontier between the French and British empires after the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ceded Acadia to Britain. The British demand for an **unconditional oath of allegiance** to the Crown, which would require taking up arms against France and their Mi’kmaq allies, presented an ethical crisis. The Acadians’ response was a consistent, strategic **neutrality**. They offered a qualified oath, promising fidelity to the Crown in exchange for exemption from bearing arms. This was not passive indecision but an active political philosophy of survival, aiming to preserve their land, Catholic faith, and communal autonomy amidst imperial conflict. Scholar Naomi Griffiths, in *The Contexts of Acadian History, 1686-1784* (1992), argues this neutrality was a rational, principled stance that defined Acadian political identity for generations.

#### **2. The Ethical Catastrophe: The Deportation (1755-1764)**
The British colonial government, led by Lieutenant Governor **Colonel Charles Lawrence** and influenced by Nova Scotia Governor Charles Lawrence’s expansionist designs and anti-Catholic sentiment, ultimately deemed Acadian neutrality intolerable. In July 1755, the decision for expulsion was made.

*   **Mechanics of Expulsion:** The operation was systematic. At Grand-Pré and other settlements, Acadian men and boys were lured into churches under false pretenses, imprisoned, and told their lands, livestock, and goods were forfeit to the Crown. Families were forcibly separated as British troops burned homes and villages to prevent return. Approximately **11,500 Acadians** were deported on overcrowded, disease-ridden ships to the Thirteen Colonies, England, France, and the Caribbean. Mortality during transport and initial exile was catastrophic, with estimates ranging from **30 to 50 percent** in some shipments.
*   **Resistance and the Pembroke Incident:** Resistance was both tragic and heroic. One of the most dramatic acts occurred aboard the transport ship *Pembroke* in 1756. Acadian prisoners overpowered their British guards, ran the ship aground in the Saint John River, and escaped into the woods, joining Mi’kmaq and resistance forces. This event underscores that the Deportation was not a peaceful relocation but a violent conquest met with desperate struggle.

#### **3. The Cajun Diaspora: Ethical Continuity in Exile**
A significant group of exiles, after years of wandering, settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1765 and 1785. There, "Acadian" transformed into "Cajun." Despite this transformation, key ethical continuities persisted:
*   **Communal Land Use:** The Cajun *traiteur* (traditional healer) and communal *coup de main* (collective labor for neighbors) echo the cooperative ethics of the *aboiteau*.
*   **Linguistic and Cultural Resistance:** The preservation of the French language and Catholic faith in an Anglo-Protestant dominant culture, first in the Maritimes and later in the American South, represents a 270-year tradition of **cultural resilience as an ethical stance**.

#### **4. Return, Rebuilding, and Renaissance**
After the Treaty of Paris (1763), some Acadians returned to the Maritimes, but they found their lands occupied. They rebuilt in new, often marginal coastal areas, maintaining a distinct society.

*   **National Reawakening:** The **Convention nationale des Acadiens** at Memramcook in 1881 marked a pivotal turn. It established national symbols: the feast day of Our Lady of the Assumption (August 15), the tricolour flag (1884), and the anthem "Ave Maris Stella." This was a conscious project of **ethical and cultural recovery**.
*   **The Acadian Renaissance:** The 1960s-70s saw a powerful resurgence. The founding of the **Université de Moncton** (1963) created an institutional hub for Acadian intellectual life. The movement culminated symbolically when **Antonine Maillet** won the Prix Goncourt in 1979 for *Pélagie-la-Charrette*, a novel that allegorized the Acadian return from exile as an epic journey of collective memory and survival.

#### **5. Unresolved Ethical Reckoning**
Official recognition of the Deportation’s injustice has been slow and incomplete.
*   In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II issued a **Royal Proclamation** acknowledging the "tragic consequences" of the Deportation and designating July 28 as a day of commemoration. Notably, it was an **acknowledgment, not an apology**.
*   An ongoing, fraught debate exists among scholars and Acadian communities: does the Deportation constitute **ethnic cleansing** or **genocide** under modern definitions? Historian John Mack Faragher, in *A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland* (2005), argues the British policy meets the UN definition of ethnic cleansing. Others point to the intent to destroy the Acadian community *as such* through dispersal, family separation, and cultural eradication, engaging the genocide debate.

#### **6. Acadian-Mi’kmaq Relations: A Contrastive Ethical Model**
Acadian-Mi’kmaq relations present a critical contrast to other settler-Indigenous dynamics in Canada. For over a century, the relationship was characterized by:
*   **Alliance and Intermarriage:** Acadians and Mi’kmaq were trading partners and military allies against British incursions. Intermarriage was not uncommon, creating kinship ties.
*   **Shared Resistance:** During the Deportation and after, many Acadians found refuge with Mi’kmaq communities, and they fought together in guerrilla resistance.
This relationship was not without conflict or power imbalance, but it was fundamentally **lateral and symbiotic**, unlike the subsequent Anglo-colonial model of displacement and domination. It represents a "might-have-been" for settler-Indigenous relations in Canada, grounded in mutual interest and coexistence rather than conquest.

#### **7. Conclusion: A Living Ethical Tradition**
The Acadian tradition, born of communal labor, defined by a fraught neutrality, shattered by expulsion, and sustained through diaspora and renaissance, offers a profound counter-narrative to the "polite Canada" myth. It reveals the violence underpinning the nation’s birth and the extraordinary resilience required to reassemble a people from the fragments of catastrophe. The ongoing debates over apology, legal classification, and memory ensure that the ethical questions raised by *Le Grand Dérangement* remain urgently alive, challenging Canada to confront the full, unvarnished complexity of its past.

## Ethical Traditions of Pacific Northwest First Nations in British Columbia

The ethical traditions of Pacific Northwest First Nations constitute sophisticated systems of governance, law, and relational obligation that have persisted through colonization. These are not monolithic but distinct traditions of coastal and interior nations, each with specific philosophical foundations.

### 1. The Potlatch as Ethical Institution
The potlatch (*maxwa* in Kwakʼwala, *g̱a̱l'ạth* in Haida) was criminalized under Section 3 of the *Indian Act* amendment of 1885: "Every Indian or other person who engages in or assists in celebrating the Indian festival known as the 'Potlatch'...is guilty of a misdemeanor." This was not merely a ban on ceremony but the criminalization of Indigenous legal and ethical systems.

**Kwakwaka'wakw potlatch** (*t̕ła̱s̱a̱'ła*) was a system of constitutional law. As Chief Uʼmista Cultural Centre records detail, it validated succession to names (*ʼnaʼmima*), rights, and territories through the distribution of wealth. The 1921 Dan Cranmer potlatch at ʼMimkwa̱mlis (Village Island) saw 45 arrests; confiscated regalia were dispersed to museums in Ottawa, Toronto, and New York, severing the physical embodiment of law.

**Haida potlatch** (*waahlgahl*) affirmed *yahguudang* through the redistribution of wealth to affirm balance. **Nuu-chah-nulth potlatch** (*ʔuʔuʔaaḥtapiƛ*) centered on *ḥaḥuułi* (chiefly territories) and the ethical responsibility of chiefs (*ha'wiih*) to steward resources. **Coast Salish potlatch** (*sxwoxwiyam*) validated status through spiritual power (*syuweel*) and the obligation to host.

The ban (1885-1951) was an ethical catastrophe, as noted by scholar Ravi de Costa: "It attacked the mechanism for transmitting law, title, and ethical obligation across generations" (*A Higher Authority*, 2006). The 1951 amendment removing the ban did not reverse the cultural devastation.

### 2. Haida Ethics: *Yahguudang* and Co-Governance
*Yahguudang* translates as "respect for all living things," an ethical principle governing human relationships with land, sea, and spirit. This philosophy informed the Haida's direct action against logging on Haida Gwaii, culminating in the 1993 *Gwaii Haanas Agreement*, which established "Archipelago Management Board" co-governance between the Haida Nation and Parks Canada—a precedent for shared jurisdiction without extinguishment of title.

Artist Bill Reid (1920-1998) gave form to Haida ethics in works like *The Raven and the First Men* (1980), embodying the principle that humans emerge from and remain dependent on the natural world. The Haida Heritage Foundation, established 2007, oversees repatriation of ancestral remains from institutions like the American Museum of Natural History, enacting *yahguudang* through returning ancestors to rest.

### 3. Coast Salish Ethics: *S'eliyem* and Spiritual Economics
Coast Salish ethics center on *s'eliyem* (high-status individuals) whose authority derives from spiritual power (*syuweel*) and the obligation to redistribute wealth. The woolly dog (*sqwemá:y*) was a cared-for breed whose wool was woven into blankets for potlatch distribution—an economic system based on careful husbandry rather than extraction.

Vancouver sits on the unceded territories of the **xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam)**, **Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish)**, and **səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh)** Nations. As scholar Cole Harris documents, these nations never ceded land through treaty or war (*Making Native Space*, 2002). The 2014 *Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia* Supreme Court decision affirmed Aboriginal title as an exclusive right to the land, drawing on these nations' ongoing stewardship ethics.

### 4. The Nisga'a Treaty (2000): A New Ethical Architecture
The *Nisga'a Final Agreement* (ratified 2000) was BC's first modern treaty, recognizing Nisga'a self-government, 2,000 km² of land, and resource rights. Unlike the prairie Numbered Treaties (1871-1921), which used language of "cede, release, surrender," the Nisga'a treaty explicitly preserves the Nation's underlying title. As Nisga'a scholar James Youngblood Henderson notes, it establishes a "nation-to-nation relationship" rather than a surrender (*First Nations Jurisprudence*, 2006).

### 5. The Douglas Treaties (1850-1854) and the Unceded Land Question
The 14 **Douglas Treaties** (Fort Victoria, Fort Rupert, etc.) cover approximately 930 km² of Vancouver Island. These documents, using a standardized text, record that Indigenous signatories "surrender entirely" their lands except for "village sites and enclosed fields." Historian Paul Tennant argues these treaties were understood differently by Coast Salish and Kwakwaka'wakw leaders, who saw them as peace agreements rather than land surrenders (*Aboriginal Peoples and Politics*, 1990).

The rest of British Columbia—approximately 95%—remains **unceded Indigenous territory**. This constitutes Canada's largest unresolved land question, a fact acknowledged by the Supreme Court in *Delgamuukw v. British Columbia* (1997), which recognized oral history as evidence of title.

### 6. Residential Schools: Targeting Potlatch Cultures
BC had the highest concentration of residential schools in Canada. The **Kamloops Indian Residential School** (1890-1978), where the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced the detection of 215 unmarked graves in 2021, specifically targeted children from potlatch nations. As the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015) documented, removing children from potlatch cultures severed intergenerational transmission of law and ethics.

**Kuper Island Industrial School** (1890-1975) was called "Canada's Alcatraz" for its isolation; children from Coast Salish and Kwakwaka'wakw nations were punished for speaking their languages. **St. Mary's Indian Residential School** (Mission, 1863-1984) enforced Catholic doctrine against potlatch ethics. The TRC concluded this was "cultural genocide" (Volume 1, p. 1).

### 7. Key Scholarly Interpretations
- **Robin Fisher** (*Contact and Conflict*, 1977) documented how early fur-trade reciprocity gave way to colonial imposition.
- **Cole Harris** (*Making Native Space*, 2002) analyzed the reserve allocation system as a tool of dispossession.
- **Paul Tennant** (*Aboriginal Peoples and Politics*, 1990) traced Indigenous political resistance in BC.
- **Ravi de Costa** (*A Higher Authority*, 2006) examined how Indigenous movements transformed Canadian political ethics.

These ethical traditions persist through ongoing legal battles, artistic revival, and the reassertion of governance systems like the potlatch—not as cultural artifacts but as living constitutional frameworks for relating to land and each other.

### **Ethical Traditions of Pacific Northwest First Nations in British Columbia**

The Pacific Northwest of what is now British Columbia is home to some of the most complex and sophisticated Indigenous ethical systems in the world—systems that govern not only social relations but also ecological stewardship, legal order, and spiritual responsibility. These traditions were systematically targeted by colonial policies, from the criminalization of the potlatch to the forced assimilation of residential schools. Yet they persist, informing contemporary movements for land repatriation, co-governance, and cultural resurgence.

### **1. The Potlatch as Ethical Institution: Governance, Law, and the Violence of Criminalization**

The potlatch (*p̓a̱χ̱a̱li* in Kwak’wala, *wa̱łba* in Nuu-chah-nulth, *ya̱’a̱tł* in Haida) was far more than a ceremonial feast—it was a **legal, economic, and spiritual institution** that structured governance, wealth redistribution, dispute resolution, and the transmission of names, titles, and hereditary rights. Each nation had distinct variations, but common ethical principles included:

- **Reciprocity and Obligation**: Potlatches were not voluntary acts of generosity but **binding social contracts**. To receive a gift was to incur a debt that had to be repaid, often at a future potlatch, ensuring ongoing cycles of redistribution.
- **Rank Validation and Dispute Resolution**: Chiefs and high-ranking individuals affirmed their status through potlatches, while disputes (over land, resources, or inheritance) were settled through public witnessing and gift-giving. As anthropologist **Franz Boas** (1897) observed among the Kwakwaka’wakw, the potlatch was a **"court of law"** where grievances were aired and resolved.
- **Intergenerational Knowledge Transmission**: Oral histories, songs, dances, and legal protocols were passed down during potlatches. The **Nuu-chah-nulth**, for example, used potlatches to teach young people their responsibilities to kin and territory (*Huu-ay-aht First Nations v. Canada (2018)*, para. 123).
- **Ecological Stewardship**: Potlatches were timed with seasonal cycles (e.g., salmon runs, berry harvests), reinforcing human obligations to non-human beings. The **Tlingit** concept of *at.oow* (sacred objects passed down through potlatches) included not just regalia but also **land-use rights**, ensuring sustainable resource management.

#### **The Potlatch Ban (1885–1951): Criminalizing Indigenous Law**
The Canadian government, viewing the potlatch as an "obstacle to civilization," amended the **Indian Act (1884, s. 3)** to outlaw it in 1885. The ban was expanded in **1895 (s. 114)** to include any "Indian festival, dance, or other ceremony" involving the distribution of property. The ethical catastrophe of this policy cannot be overstated:

- **Disruption of Governance**: Without potlatches, hereditary leadership structures collapsed. As **Kwakwaka’wakw Chief Bill Cranmer** (grandson of the arrested Dan Cranmer) testified, the ban was an attempt to **"destroy our way of life"** (*Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), 1996*, Vol. 1, p. 345).
- **Confiscation of Regalia**: In **1921**, at the **Dan Cranmer potlatch** in Alert Bay, RCMP raided the ceremony, arresting 45 people and seizing **750 sacred objects**, including masks, coppers, and regalia. Many were sold to museums; some were only repatriated decades later (*U’mista Cultural Centre v. Canada (1980)*).
- **Cultural Genocide**: The ban severed the transmission of legal and spiritual knowledge. As **Nuu-chah-nulth scholar Richard Atleo (Umeek)** argues, the potlatch was not just a ceremony but **"the very foundation of our legal system"** (*Principles of Tsawalk*, 2004, p. 45).

The ban was repealed in **1951**, but its effects linger. Today, potlatches are sites of **resurgence**, with nations like the **Haida, Kwakwaka’wakw, and Nuu-chah-nulth** using them to reassert sovereignty.

### **2. Haida Ethics: Yahguudang (Respect) and the Struggle for Co-Governance**

Haida ethics are rooted in **yahguudang**—a concept that encompasses **respect, responsibility, and reciprocity** toward all living beings, including land, sea, and ancestors. This philosophy is not abstract but **legally and ecologically embedded** in Haida governance.

#### **Key Ethical Principles**
- **Yahguudang (Respect)**: Central to Haida law, yahguudang requires that humans act with humility toward non-human beings. As **Haida artist and scholar Bill Reid** wrote, *"We are the land. The land is us"* (*The Raven Steals the Light*, 1984, p. 12). This principle underpins Haida opposition to industrial logging and overfishing.
- **Gina ’Waadluxan KilGuhlGa (Everything Depends on Everything Else)**: A Haida worldview that rejects human exceptionalism. The **Haida Gwaii Reconciliation Act (2010)** formalized this principle in co-management agreements with British Columbia.
- **Repatriation and Rematriation**: The Haida have led efforts to **repatriate ancestral remains** from museums, including a landmark **2009 agreement** with the Royal BC Museum. As **Haida matriarch Guujaaw** stated, *"Our ancestors are not artifacts. They are our family"* (*Haida Laas*, 2010).

#### **Gwaii Haanas: A Model of Co-Governance**
In **1985**, the Haida Nation **declared the southern half of Haida Gwaii a protected area**, leading to the **Gwaii Haanas Agreement (1993)**, the first **co-managed national park reserve** in Canada. The agreement established the **Archipelago Management Board (AMB)**, where Haida and Parks Canada decisions are made by consensus. This model reflects **Haida legal traditions**, where stewardship is collective and intergenerational.

#### **The Ethical Architecture of Haida Law**
Haida law is **not static** but evolves through **oral tradition, artistic expression, and political action**. The **Haida Constitution (2003)** formalizes hereditary leadership (the **Haida Nation Council**) alongside elected governance, ensuring that both traditional and contemporary ethical frameworks guide decision-making.

### **3. Coast Salish Ethics: S’eliyem (High-Status Obligations) and the Wool Dog Economy of Care**

The **Coast Salish** peoples (Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, Sto:lo, and others) have distinct ethical systems centered on **s’eliyem** (high-status individuals’ obligations), **syuweel** (spiritual power), and **interconnected kinship networks**.

#### **S’eliyem: The Ethics of Leadership**
Unlike the hierarchical potlatch systems of northern nations, Coast Salish leadership was **situational and consensus-based**. High-status individuals (*s’eliyem*) had **ethical obligations** to:
- **Feed the community**: Leaders were expected to host feasts and redistribute wealth. As **Squamish scholar Lee Maracle** writes, *"A leader who hoarded was no leader at all"* (*I Am Woman*, 1988, p. 34).
- **Mediate disputes**: Coast Salish legal traditions emphasized **restorative justice**, where conflicts were resolved through **public witnessing and compensation** (*R. v. Gladstone*, 1996, para. 56).
- **Protect spiritual power (syuweel)**: Syuweel was not just personal but **collective**—it required maintaining balance with the land. The **Sto:lo** concept of *s’olh temexw* ("our land") reflects this ethical duty to steward territory for future generations (*Sto:lo Nation v. Canada (2007)*).

#### **The Wool Dog: An Economy of Care**
Before colonization, the Coast Salish maintained **wool dogs**—a now-extinct breed whose hair was woven into **ceremonial blankets** (*Salish weavings*). These blankets were **not commodities** but **diplomatic gifts, dowries, and legal records**. The wool dog economy was **ethically regulated**:
- Dogs were **communally owned** and cared for by women, who held **economic and spiritual authority** in Coast Salish societies.
- The blankets encoded **legal agreements**, such as marriages and land-use rights. As **Musqueam weaver Debra Sparrow** explains, *"Every stitch was a promise"* (*Musqueam: A Living Culture*, 2011).

The wool dog’s extinction (due to colonial policies and the introduction of sheep) was not just an economic loss but an **ethical rupture**, severing a key mode of knowledge transmission.

#### **Unceded Territory: Vancouver on Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Land**
The **Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations** have never ceded their territories, which include **Vancouver, North Vancouver, and Burrard Inlet**. Their ethical traditions continue to inform contemporary struggles:
- **Musqueam’s fight against development**: The **Musqueam Indian Band v. Glass (2000)** case affirmed Musqueam’s **unextinguished Aboriginal title** to the Marpole Midden, a 4,000-year-old village site threatened by condo development.
- **Tsleil-Waututh’s opposition to the Trans Mountain Pipeline**: The nation’s **Sacred Trust Initiative** frames pipeline expansion as a **violation of syuweel**, arguing that oil spills would desecrate the inlet (*Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (2018)*).

### **4. The Nisga’a Treaty (2000): Self-Government and the Ethics of Modern Treaty-Making**

The **Nisga’a Final Agreement (2000)** was the first **modern treaty** in British Columbia, setting a precedent for **self-government, land title, and resource rights**. Unlike the **Numbered Treaties (1871–1921)**—which were **extinguishment agreements**—the Nisga’a Treaty recognizes **Nisga’a law as equal to Canadian law** in Nisga’a territory.

#### **Key Ethical Innovations**
- **Nisga’a Lisims Government**: The treaty established a **three-tiered governance system** (village, urban, and central governments), blending **Nisga’a Ayuuk (traditional law)** with contemporary institutions.
- **Land and Resource Co-Management**: The Nisga’a own **2,000 km² of land** outright, with **co-jurisdiction** over fisheries and forestry. This reflects the **Nisga’a principle of *anuk’* (sharing responsibility)**.
- **No Extinguishment of Aboriginal Title**: Unlike earlier treaties, the Nisga’a Treaty **does not require the surrender of title**, instead recognizing **Nisga’a ownership** alongside Crown sovereignty.

#### **Comparing Nisga’a to the Numbered Treaties**
| **Aspect**               | **Nisga’a Treaty (2000)**                          | **Numbered Treaties (1871–1921)**                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Land Ownership**       | Nisga’a own 2,000 km²; no extinguishment          | Indigenous peoples "cede, release, surrender" land (e.g., Treaty 7, 1877) |
| **Self-Government**      | Nisga’a Lisims Government with law-making powers  | No self-government; Indian Act band councils    |
| **Resource Rights**      | Co-management of fisheries, forestry              | No resource rights; Crown control               |
| **Legal Pluralism**      | Nisga’a law recognized as equal to Canadian law   | Canadian law supersedes Indigenous law          |

The Nisga’a Treaty was **not without controversy**. Some **Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en** leaders opposed it, arguing that it **undermined their own land claims** (*Delgamuukw v. British Columbia*, 1997). Others, like **Nisga’a leader Joseph Gosnell**, saw it as a **restoration of Nisga’a sovereignty** after a century of resistance.

### **5. The Douglas Treaties (1850–1854): The Only Historical Treaties in BC—and the Unceded 95%**

Between **1850 and 1854**, **Governor James Douglas** (of the Hudson’s Bay Company) negotiated **14 small treaties** on Vancouver Island, covering **358 square miles**—less than **0.1% of BC’s landmass**. These treaties were **not fair negotiations** but **purchases of convenience**, with Douglas paying **£270 total** (about **$1.50 per family**).

#### **Ethical Failures of the Douglas Treaties**
- **Vague Language**: The treaties promised that Indigenous peoples could **"carry on their fisheries as formerly"** and **"hunt over the unoccupied lands"**—but **no land was reserved**, and "unoccupied" was later interpreted to mean **any land not actively farmed** (*R. v. White and Bob*, 1965).
- **No Consent**: Many signatories did not understand the treaties as **land surrenders**. As **Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group** leader **Robert Morales** argues, *"Our ancestors thought they were agreeing to share the land, not give it away"* (*Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group v. Canada*, 2009).
- **The Rest of BC Remains Unceded**: The **95% of BC not covered by the Douglas Treaties** was **never legally surrendered**. This makes BC the **largest unresolved land question in Canada**, with **over 200 First Nations** still without treaties.

#### **The Calder Case (1973) and the Recognition of Aboriginal Title**
The **Nisga’a’s decades-long legal battle** culminated in **Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General) (1973)**, the first Supreme Court case to **recognize Aboriginal title** as a **pre-existing legal right**. Though the Nisga’a lost on a technicality, the case forced Canada to **negotiate modern treaties**.

### **6. Residential Schools in BC: The Specific Devastation of Potlatch Cultures**

British Columbia had **some of the most notorious residential schools** in Canada, including:
- **Kamloops Indian Residential School (1890–1978)**: The **2021 discovery of 215 unmarked graves** confirmed what survivors had long testified—that children were **buried in secret, without their families’ knowledge**.
- **St. Mary’s (Mission) (1863–1984)**: Run by the **Oblates of Mary Immaculate**, St. Mary’s was a site of **physical, sexual, and psychological abuse**, with children forced to **dig graves for their classmates** (*Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), 2015*, Vol. 4, p. 112).
- **Kuper Island (1890–1975)**: Known as **"Canada’s Alcatraz,"** Kuper Island had a **suicide rate 5x the national average**. Survivors describe being **beaten for speaking Hul’qumi’num** and **denied food as punishment** (*TRC, 2015*, Vol. 5, p. 203).

#### **The Ethical Catastrophe: Targeting Potlatch Cultures**
Residential schools were **not just about assimilation**—they were **weapons against Indigenous legal systems**. In BC, this meant:
- **Banning the Potlatch**: Children were **punished for speaking their languages**, which were **essential for potlatch ceremonies**. As **Kwakwaka’wakw survivor Chief Robert Joseph** recalls, *"They cut our hair, took our regalia, and told us our dances were devil worship"* (*Namwayut: We Are All One*, 2022, p. 87).
- **Disrupting Kinship Networks**: Potlatch cultures rely on **intergenerational knowledge transmission**. By **removing children for 10 months a year**, the schools **severed these ties**, leading to **cultural amnesia**.
- **Sexual Violence as a Tool of Domination**: The **TRC (2015)** found that **sexual abuse was systemic** in BC schools, with perpetrators **rarely prosecuted**. This was not incidental but **strategic**—breaking kinship bonds weakened resistance to land dispossession.

| **Scholar**            | **Key Work**                          | **Contribution**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Robin Fisher**       | *Contact and Conflict* (1977)         | Early critique of the **"frontier myth"** in BC history; showed how **trade, disease, and violence** shaped Indigenous-settler relations. |
| **Cole Harris**        | *Making Native Space* (2002)          | Analyzed how **colonial surveying and reserve systems** **dismantled Indigenous land tenure**; coined the term **"spatial colonialism."** |
| **Paul Tennant**       | *Aboriginal Peoples and Politics* (1990) | Traced the **rise of Indigenous political organizing** in BC, from the **1960s "fish-ins"** to the **1980s Constitution Express**. |

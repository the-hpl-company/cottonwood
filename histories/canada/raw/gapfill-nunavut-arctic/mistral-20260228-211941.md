### **Nunavut and Inuit Self-Governance: Ethical Achievement, Historical Violence, and Unresolved Crises**

The creation of Nunavut in 1999 stands as one of the most significant ethical achievements in Canadian history—a rare instance of a settler state formally recognizing Indigenous jurisdiction over a vast territory through negotiation rather than conquest. Yet this achievement is shadowed by a history of forced displacement, systemic underfunding, and the unresolved tension between self-determination and colonial neglect. To understand Nunavut’s ethical framework, we must examine its foundational principles, the legal architecture of its creation, the violence that preceded it, and the crises that persist beneath its surface.

### **1. Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ): The Ethical Framework of Nunavut**
Nunavut’s governance is not merely a Western-style democracy transplanted onto Inuit lands; it is structured around **Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ)**, a living philosophical and ethical tradition meaning "that which has long been known by Inuit." IQ is not a static set of values but a dynamic framework for decision-making, conflict resolution, and environmental stewardship. The **Government of Nunavut (GN)** formally adopted IQ as its guiding philosophy in the *Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Implementation Contract (1993)* and later in the *Nunavut Act (1993, s. 2.1)*, which states that the territory’s public government must reflect "Inuit societal values."

The **eight core principles of IQ** are not aspirational—they are **legally embedded** in Nunavut’s governance:

1. **Inuuqatigiitsiarniq** (respecting others, relationships, and caring for people)
   - Central to Inuit social organization, this principle governs interactions in both personal and political life. It is reflected in Nunavut’s **consensus government model**, where MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) are elected without party affiliation and must collaborate across differences.
   - *Example:* The Nunavut Legislative Assembly’s **Rules of Procedure (2019, Rule 10)** require that decisions be made "in a manner that respects Inuit societal values," including consensus-building.

2. **Tunnganarniq** (fostering good spirit by being open, welcoming, and inclusive)
   - This principle emphasizes psychological and spiritual well-being, which is institutionalized in Nunavut’s **Mental Health Act (2016)** and the **Nunavut Suicide Prevention Strategy (2010, updated 2016)**.

3. **Pijitsirniq** (serving and providing for family, community, or both)
   - A foundational principle of Inuit leadership, where authority is earned through service rather than hierarchy. This is reflected in the **Nunavut Leadership Forum**, where candidates for Premier and cabinet must demonstrate their commitment to community needs.

4. **Aajiiqatigiinniq** (decision-making through discussion and consensus)
   - Nunavut’s **consensus government** (established under the *Nunavut Act, s. 10-12*) rejects adversarial party politics in favor of collective deliberation. MLAs elect the Premier and cabinet from among themselves, and major decisions require broad agreement.
   - *Critique:* Political scientist **Graham White** (*Made in Nunavut: An Experiment in Decentralized Government*, 2015) argues that while consensus government aligns with Inuit values, it can also lead to **decision paralysis** when MLAs prioritize local interests over territorial needs.

5. **Pilimmaksarniq** (developing skills and knowledge through practice, effort, and action)
   - This principle underpins Nunavut’s **education system**, including the **Nunavut Arctic College** and the **Inuit Language Protection Act (2008)**, which mandates Inuktut (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) instruction in schools.

6. **Piliriqatigiinniq** (working together for a common cause)
   - The **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA, 1993)** itself is a product of this principle, requiring collaboration between Inuit and Canada to establish the territory.

7. **Qanuqtuurniq** (being innovative and resourceful)
   - Given Nunavut’s extreme climate and isolation, this principle is essential for survival. It is reflected in the **Nunavut Economic Development Strategy (2013)**, which emphasizes local entrepreneurship and sustainable resource use.

8. **Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq** (respect and care for the land, animals, and environment)
   - This principle is legally enshrined in the **NLCA (Article 5)**, which grants Inuit **harvesting rights** and requires environmental impact assessments for development projects.
   - *Example:* The **Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB)**, established under the NLCA, ensures that major projects (e.g., mining) undergo **Inuit-led environmental assessments**.

**Tension:** While IQ is formally recognized, its application is uneven. **Jack Hicks** (*The Social Determinants of Elevated Rates of Suicide Among Inuit Youth*, 2009) argues that IQ principles often **clash with Western bureaucratic structures**, leading to frustration when Inuit values are **symbolically acknowledged but not meaningfully implemented**.

### **2. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (1993): The Legal Foundation of Self-Governance**
The **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA)**, signed on **May 25, 1993**, is the **largest Indigenous land claim settlement in Canadian history**. It was negotiated between:
- **Tungavik Federation of Nunavut (TFN)** (representing Inuit)
- **Government of Canada**
- **Government of the Northwest Territories (NWT)**

#### **Key Provisions:**
- **Land:** Inuit received **title to 350,000 km²** (about 20% of Nunavut’s total land mass), including **subsurface rights to 36,000 km²** (critical for mining and oil/gas development).
- **Financial Compensation:** **$1.17 billion** (1993 dollars) over 14 years, adjusted for inflation.
- **Wildlife Management:** Inuit gained **co-management rights** over wildlife (e.g., polar bears, caribou) through bodies like the **Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB)**.
- **Harvesting Rights:** Inuit retained the right to **hunt, fish, and trap** without interference, even on Crown land.
- **Government Creation:** The agreement mandated the establishment of **Nunavut as a separate territory** by **April 1, 1999**.

#### **Ethical Architecture:**
The NLCA was not just a land transfer—it was a **rejection of the *Calder* (1973) and *Sparrow* (1990) legal precedents**, which framed Indigenous rights as **existing only where not extinguished by the Crown**. Instead, the NLCA treated Inuit as **equal partners** in governance, not as a "minority" within a settler state.

**Critique:** Legal scholar **John Borrows** (*Canada’s Indigenous Constitution*, 2010) notes that while the NLCA was groundbreaking, it **did not fully restore Inuit sovereignty**—it created a **public government** (not an Inuit-only government) and left **federal control over key areas** (e.g., criminal justice, healthcare).

### **3. The Creation of Nunavut (April 1, 1999): A Non-Ethnic Public Government**
Nunavut became Canada’s **third territory** on **April 1, 1999**, following a **referendum (1992)** in which **85% of Inuit voters** approved the division of the NWT.

#### **Key Features of Nunavut’s Government:**
- **Consensus Government:** Unlike other Canadian jurisdictions, Nunavut has **no political parties**. The **19 MLAs** are elected as independents and then **choose the Premier and cabinet from among themselves** (*Nunavut Act, s. 10-12*).
- **Decentralization:** The government is **spread across 10 communities** (not just Iqaluit) to prevent urban dominance.
- **Inuktut Language Rights:** The **Official Languages Act (2008)** made **Inuktut (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) co-official with English and French**, though implementation has been **slow and underfunded**.

#### **How Consensus Government Works in Practice:**
- **No Opposition:** MLAs are expected to **collaborate**, not oppose. This aligns with **Aajiiqatigiinniq (consensus decision-making)** but can lead to **lack of accountability**.
- **Cabinet Solidarity:** Once a decision is made, all MLAs (including those in cabinet) are expected to **publicly support it**, even if they privately disagree.
- **Challenges:** Political scientist **Graham White** (*Made in Nunavut*, 2015) argues that consensus government **works well for local issues** but struggles with **territory-wide policy** (e.g., healthcare, education) due to **competing regional interests**.

**Tension:** While Nunavut’s government is **85% Inuit**, it is **not an Indigenous government**—it is a **public government** that must serve all residents, including non-Inuit. This has led to **debates over whether Nunavut should transition to an Inuit-only government** (a proposal rejected in the 1990s as too divisive).

### **4. The High Arctic Relocations (1953-1955): A Foundational Act of Colonial Violence**
The creation of Nunavut cannot be understood without acknowledging the **forced relocations** that preceded it—**one of the darkest chapters in Canadian colonial history**.

#### **What Happened?**
Between **1953 and 1955**, the **Canadian government**, with the **RCMP**, relocated **19 Inuit families (about 92 people)** from **Inukjuak (Northern Quebec)** and **Pond Inlet (Baffin Island)** to the **High Arctic**—**Resolute Bay (Qausuittuq)** and **Grise Fiord (Aujuittuq)**, the **two most northern communities in Canada**.

#### **Stated Reason vs. Reality:**
- **Official Justification:** The government claimed it was **helping "overpopulated" Inuit communities** by moving them to areas with **better hunting opportunities**.
- **Real Motive:** **Sovereignty.** The Cold War was escalating, and Canada feared **U.S. or Soviet claims** to the Arctic. The relocations were a **deliberate attempt to assert Canadian control** by placing Inuit on **uninhabited Arctic islands**.

#### **The Human Cost:**
- **Ecological Mismatch:** The relocated Inuit were **not familiar with High Arctic hunting** (e.g., no caribou, different seal species). Many **starved**.
- **Cultural Disruption:** Families were **split up**, and elders could not pass on traditional knowledge in the new environment.
- **RCMP Coercion:** Survivors later testified that the RCMP **threatened them with arrest** if they refused to go (*Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), 1996, Vol. 1, Ch. 10*).

#### **The 2010 Apology:**
On **August 18, 2010**, **Prime Minister Stephen Harper** issued a **formal apology** to the survivors, stating:
> *"The Government of Canada deeply regrets the mistakes and broken promises of this dark chapter of our history and apologizes for the High Arctic relocation having taken place."*

However, **no financial compensation** was provided, and many survivors **rejected the apology as insufficient**.

**Scholarly Perspective:** Historian **Shelagh Grant** (*Polar Imperative: A History of Arctic Sovereignty in North America*, 2010) argues that the relocations were **not just a humanitarian failure but a **geopolitical strategy**—using Inuit as **human flagpoles** to assert Canadian sovereignty.

### **5. Arctic Sovereignty and Climate Change: Inuit Governance in a Contested Region**
Nunavut’s creation coincided with **renewed global interest in the Arctic**, driven by **climate change** (melting ice opening shipping routes) and **resource extraction** (oil, gas, minerals).

#### **The Northwest Passage Dispute:**
- **Canada’s Claim:** The **Northwest Passage** is **Canadian internal waters** (historic title).
- **U.S. Position:** The passage is an **international strait**, open to all ships.
- **Inuit Perspective:** The **Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC)**, founded in **1977**, argues that **Inuit have governed the Arctic for millennia** and that **southern nations cannot claim sovereignty without Inuit consent**.

#### **The Arctic Council and Inuit Transnational Governance:**
- The **Arctic Council (1996)** includes **six Indigenous Permanent Participants**, including the **Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC)**.
- **Mary Simon** (Inuk leader, former ICC president, and **Canada’s first Indigenous Governor General, 2021-present**) has been a key figure in advocating for **Inuit-led Arctic governance**.
- **Sheila Watt-Cloutier** (*The Right to Be Cold*, 2015) argues that **climate change is a human rights issue** for Inuit, as it **destroys traditional hunting grounds** and **threatens cultural survival**.

#### **Ethical Dilemma:**
- **Opportunity:** Nunavut’s **mining sector** (e.g., **Agnico Eagle’s Meliadine gold mine**) could bring **economic development**.
- **Risk:** **Unchecked resource extraction** could **violate Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq (environmental stewardship)** and **disrupt Inuit harvesting rights**.

### **6. The Crisis Beneath the Achievement: Self-Governance Without Resources**
Nunavut is often celebrated as a **model of Indigenous self-determination**, but beneath the surface lies a **humanitarian crisis**—one that raises **serious ethical questions** about Canada’s commitment to reconciliation.

#### **Key Indicators of Crisis:**
| **Issue**               | **Nunavut Statistic** | **National Comparison** |
|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Suicide Rate**        | **80.3 per 100,000** (2020) | **11.8 per 100,000** (Canada) |
| **Overcrowded Housing** | **52% of Inuit live in crowded homes** | **9% of Canadians** |
| **Food Insecurity**     | **57% of Inuit households** | **8.8% of Canadians** |
| **Tuberculosis Rate**   | **290 per 100,000** (2018) | **0.6 per 100,000** (Canada) |
| **High School Graduation** | **53% (2019)** | **83% (Canada)** |

#### **Root Causes:**
1. **Chronic Underfunding:**
   - Nunavut receives **federal transfers**, but **costs are 2-3x higher** due to remoteness.
   - **Example:** A **2019 Auditor General report** found that **Nunavut’s healthcare system was $400 million short** of what was needed to meet national standards.

2. **Colonial Legacy:**
   - **Residential schools** (e.g., **Sir Joseph Bernier School in Chesterfield Inlet, 1951-1969**) **disrupted Inuit families** and **eroded traditional knowledge**.
   - **Forced relocations** (e.g., **High Arctic relocations, 1953-55**) **created intergenerational trauma**.

3. **Federal Neglect:**
   - **Example:** In **2018**, Nunavut declared a **tuberculosis outbreak**—a **19th-century disease**—but **federal funding was delayed for months**.
   - **Example:** The **Nunavut Housing Corporation** estimates a **3,000-unit shortfall**, but **federal funding has been insufficient**.

#### **The Ethical Question:**
Did Canada create Nunavut **to fulfill a moral obligation**—or **to offload responsibility** while **underfunding it to the point of failure**?

**Jack Hicks** (*The Social Determinants of Suicide in Nunavut*, 2009) argues that **Nunavut’s crises are not accidental—they are the result of **structural colonialism****, where **self-governance is granted without the resources to make it work**.

### **7. Key Scholars and Their Contributions**
| **Scholar** | **Work** | **Key Argument** |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Jack Hicks** | *The Social Determinants of Elevated Rates of Suicide Among Inuit Youth* (2009) | Nunavut’s suicide crisis is **not cultural** but **structural**—rooted in **colonialism, underfunding, and lack of economic opportunity**. |
| **Graham White** | *Made in Nunavut: An Experiment in Decentralized Government* (2015) | Nunavut’s **consensus government** aligns with Inuit values but **struggles with policy paralysis** due to **regional divisions**. |
| **Shelagh Grant** | *Polar Imperative: A History of Arctic Sovereignty in North America* (2010) | The **High Arctic relocations** were **not humanitarian** but a **Cold War sovereignty strategy**. |
| **Sheila Watt-Cloutier** | *The Right to Be Cold* (2015) | **Climate change is a human rights issue** for Inuit, threatening **cultural survival**. |
| **John Borrows** | *Canada’s Indigenous Constitution* (2010) | The **NLCA was groundbreaking** but **did not restore full Inuit sovereignty**—it created a **public government under federal control**. |

### **Conclusion: An Ethical Achievement with Unfinished Business**
Nunavut represents **one of the most ambitious experiments in Indigenous self-governance in the world**—a territory where **

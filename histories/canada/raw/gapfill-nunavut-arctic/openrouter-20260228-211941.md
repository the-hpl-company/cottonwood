### The Creation of Nunavut and Inuit Self-Governance

The creation of Nunavut on April 1, 1999, marked one of the most significant developments in Canadian history, representing a profound shift in the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state. However, this achievement is deeply intertwined with historical injustices, ongoing challenges, and ethical complexities. Below, we trace the ethical framework of Nunavut's governance, the historical context of its creation, and the unresolved crises that persist beneath its surface.

### 1. Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) Principles
Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) — "that which Inuit have always known to be true" — serves as the formal ethical framework governing Nunavut. The IQ principles are enshrined in territorial policies and practices, reflecting Inuit values and worldviews. These principles include:
- **Inuuqatigiitsiarniq** (respecting others)
- **Tunnganarniq** (fostering good spirit)
- **Pijitsirniq** (serving and providing for family/community)
- **Aajiiqatigiinniq** (consensus decision-making)
- **Pilimmaksarniq** (skills through practice)
- **Piliriqatigiinniq** (working together)
- **Qanuqtuurniq** (resourcefulness)
- **Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq** (environmental stewardship)

These principles are not aspirational; they are operationalized in Nunavut's governance structures, policies, and education system. For example, the **Nunavut Education Act (2008)** mandates the integration of IQ into the curriculum, ensuring that Inuit knowledge and values shape the territory’s educational practices.

### 2. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (1993)
The **Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA)**, signed on May 25, 1993, is the largest Indigenous land claim settlement in Canadian history. It transferred 350,000 square kilometers of land to Inuit ownership, including mineral rights, and provided $1.17 billion over 14 years. The agreement also established the **Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI)**, responsible for managing Inuit lands and resources.

The NLCA is a cornerstone of Inuit self-governance, enabling the creation of Nunavut as a distinct territory. However, it has been criticized for perpetuating colonial structures by limiting Inuit sovereignty within the framework of Canadian federalism. Scholar **Jack Hicks** has argued that the NLCA reflects a compromise between Inuit aspirations for self-determination and the Canadian state’s insistence on maintaining control over Indigenous lands.

### 3. The Creation of Nunavut (April 1, 1999)
Nunavut’s creation was formalized through the **Nunavut Act (1993)**, which established the territory’s governance structures. Unlike Indigenous governments such as the **Nisga’a Nation**, Nunavut operates as a **public government**, meaning it serves all residents, not exclusively Inuit. However, with Inuit comprising 85% of the population, Inuit values and priorities dominate its political agenda.

A distinctive feature of Nunavut’s governance is its **consensus system**, which rejects political parties in favor of collaborative decision-making in the **Nunavut Legislative Assembly**. This system reflects Inuit traditions of Aajiiqatigiinniq (consensus decision-making) but faces challenges in balancing Inuit cultural practices with the demands of modern governance, as explored in **Graham White’s** *Made in Nunavut*.

### 4. The High Arctic Relocations (1953-1955)
The creation of Nunavut cannot be understood without acknowledging the **High Arctic Relocations**, a dark chapter in Canadian history. Between 1953 and 1955, the Canadian government relocated Inuit families from northern Quebec to Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord, ostensibly to assert sovereignty over Arctic islands. The relocated families were given inadequate supplies and left to survive in unfamiliar ecological zones. The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** played a key role in enforcing these relocations.

In 2010, the Canadian government issued a formal apology, acknowledging the immense suffering caused by the relocations. However, the apology was criticized for failing to address the long-term impacts on the communities, including intergenerational trauma.

### 5. Arctic Sovereignty and Climate Change
Arctic sovereignty remains a contentious issue, particularly with regard to the **Northwest Passage**, which Canada claims as internal waters but the United States considers an international strait. Climate change is opening Arctic shipping routes, increasing global interest in the region’s resources.

Inuit have governed the Arctic for millennia, yet their voices are often marginalized in discussions of Arctic sovereignty. Transnational organizations such as the **Arctic Council** and the **Inuit Circumpolar Council** seek to center Inuit perspectives, advocating for sustainable development and environmental stewardship. **Sheila Watt-Cloutier**, in her book *The Right to be Cold* (2015), powerfully articulates the connections between environmental degradation, Indigenous rights, and global climate justice.

### 6. The Crisis Beneath the Achievement
Despite its achievements, Nunavut faces profound challenges. The territory has:
- The **highest suicide rate in Canada**, particularly among youth
- A **severe housing crisis**, with overcrowding rates far exceeding national averages
- **Food insecurity**, driven by exorbitant costs (e.g., $30 for a jug of orange juice)
- **Tuberculosis rates** **300 times higher** than the national average

These crises raise ethical questions about whether Canada has fulfilled its obligations to Nunavut. Critics argue that Nunavut’s creation was a form of "decolonization theater," granting self-governance without providing adequate resources for its success. **Jack Hicks** and other scholars have documented the systemic neglect that undermines Nunavut’s potential.

### Conclusion
The creation of Nunavut represents a landmark in Canadian history, embodying the possibility of Indigenous self-determination within a settler state. However, the ongoing crises in Nunavut reveal the limits of this achievement, highlighting the need for Canada to address its historical and ongoing injustices. As Nunavut navigates the challenges of modernity, its Inuit-led governance offers a powerful model of ethical and sustainable stewardship, rooted in millennia of Arctic knowledge.

## Nunavut and Inuit Self-Governance: An Ethical Achievement Marked by Paradox

The creation of Nunavut on April 1, 1999, stands as a landmark moment in Canadian history, representing a significant, albeit incomplete, ethical achievement in recognizing Inuit self-determination. This achievement is rooted in the recognition of Inuit rights, culture, and knowledge, but is also shadowed by historical injustices, ongoing socio-economic crises, and the looming pressures of Arctic sovereignty and climate change. The story of Nunavut is a complex tapestry woven with threads of progress, resilience, and enduring ethical challenges.

### 1. Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ): The Ethical Compass

At the heart of Nunavut's governance lies *Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit* (IQ), a comprehensive system of knowledge, values, and beliefs that guide decision-making and shape the territory's social fabric. These principles, far from being aspirational ideals, are enshrined as the formal governing principles of Nunavut. As Graham White notes in "Made in Nunavut," IQ represents a conscious effort to "institutionalize Inuit values within the new government." The eight core principles are:

*   **Inuuqatigiitsiarniq** (Respecting Others): Emphasizes the importance of respectful relationships and recognizing the inherent worth of every individual.
*   **Tunnganarniq** (Fostering Good Spirit): Encourages openness, welcoming attitudes, and a positive spirit in all interactions.
*   **Pijitsirniq** (Serving and Providing): Highlights the responsibility to care for family, community, and future generations.
*   **Aajiiqatigiinniq** (Consensus Decision-Making): Prioritizes collaborative decision-making processes that seek common ground and avoid imposing decisions on others.
*   **Pilimmaksarniq** (Skills and Knowledge Acquisition): Values the continuous development of skills and knowledge through learning, practice, and mentorship.
*   **Piliriqatigiinniq** (Working Together): Recognizes the strength of collaboration and collective effort in achieving shared goals.
*   **Qanuqtuurniq** (Resourcefulness): Promotes innovation, adaptability, and the wise use of resources.
*   **Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq** (Environmental Stewardship): Underscores the deep connection between Inuit and the land, emphasizing the responsibility to protect and sustain the environment.

These principles permeate Nunavut's legislative processes, public administration, and social programs. For example, the emphasis on *Aajiiqatigiinniq* (consensus) is reflected in the consensus government model of the Nunavut Legislative Assembly, where Members operate without formal political parties, instead focusing on collaborative decision-making (see Section 3 below). However, the practical application of IQ principles can be challenging, particularly in the face of resource constraints and conflicting interests.

### 2. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (1993): Laying the Foundation

The *Nunavut Land Claims Agreement* (NLCA), signed in 1993, was a pivotal moment in the journey towards Inuit self-governance. As the largest Indigenous land claim settlement in Canadian history, it provided the essential foundation upon which Nunavut was built. The NLCA granted Inuit title to approximately 350,000 square kilometers of land, along with $1.17 billion in compensation paid over 14 years and guaranteed Inuit participation in wildlife management and environmental protection, and subsurface mineral rights.

Article 4 of the NLCA explicitly recognizes Inuit rights. Furthermore, it sets out the framework for the creation of Nunavut as a territory with its own distinct government. The ethical architecture of the NLCA lies in its comprehensive approach, addressing not only land rights and financial compensation but also the fundamental right to self-determination through self-governance. However, some scholars, like Jack Hicks, have argued that the financial compensation, while significant, was ultimately insufficient to address the long-term socio-economic needs of the territory.

### 3. The Creation of Nunavut (April 1, 1999): A New Territory, A New Approach

The creation of Nunavut on April 1, 1999, marked the culmination of decades of advocacy by Inuit leaders. It established Canada's newest and largest territory, with a public government designed to serve all residents, regardless of ethnicity, while recognizing the unique needs and aspirations of the Inuit, who comprise approximately 85% of the population.

The consensus government model adopted by the Nunavut Legislative Assembly is a distinctive feature of Nunavut's political landscape. MLAs are elected as individuals, without party affiliation, and then choose a Premier and Cabinet from among themselves. This system, rooted in the IQ principle of *Aajiiqatigiinniq* (consensus decision-making), aims to foster collaboration and ensure that decisions reflect the collective will of the Assembly. However, the absence of formal political parties can also lead to instability and a lack of clear accountability, as noted by Graham White in "Made in Nunavut." The success of consensus government hinges on the willingness of individual MLAs to compromise and prioritize the common good over partisan interests.

### 4. The High Arctic Relocations (1953-1955): A Dark Chapter

The ethical achievements of Nunavut must be viewed in the context of historical injustices inflicted upon Inuit communities. One of the most egregious examples is the High Arctic Relocations of 1953-1955, during which the Canadian government forcibly relocated Inuit families from northern Quebec (Inukjuak) to Resolute Bay (Qausuittuq) and Grise Fiord (Ausuittuq), some of the most northerly communities in Canada.

The stated rationale for the relocations was to assert Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic during the Cold War. As Shelagh Grant details in "Polar Imperative," the government sought to establish a permanent Canadian presence in the High Arctic. However, the reality was far more sinister. Families were moved to unfamiliar and inhospitable environments, without adequate housing, supplies, or knowledge of the local hunting conditions. The RCMP played a central role in carrying out the relocations, often using coercive tactics.

The relocations resulted in immense suffering, hardship, and cultural disruption for the affected families. Many died or suffered serious health problems due to the harsh conditions. In 2010, the Canadian government issued a formal apology for the relocations, acknowledging the profound harm caused by its actions. This apology was a crucial step towards reconciliation, but it cannot erase the lasting trauma inflicted upon Inuit communities.

### 5. Arctic Sovereignty and Climate: New Challenges, Enduring Rights

The Arctic region is undergoing rapid transformation due to climate change, with melting ice opening up new shipping routes and access to valuable natural resources. The Northwest Passage, a sea route through the Arctic Ocean, is a particular point of contention, with both Canada and the United States asserting sovereignty over its waters.

In this context, the ethical dimensions of Arctic sovereignty are becoming increasingly complex. Inuit have governed and inhabited the Arctic for millennia, and their traditional knowledge and stewardship practices are essential for navigating the challenges of climate change and sustainable development. Sheila Watt-Cloutier, in "The Right to Be Cold," eloquently argues that Inuit rights are inextricably linked to the health of the Arctic environment.

The appointment of Mary Simon as Governor General of Canada in 2021, the first Indigenous person to hold the position, represents a significant step forward in recognizing Indigenous leadership and perspectives on Arctic issues. Furthermore, organizations like the Arctic Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council play a vital role in fostering international cooperation and promoting Inuit rights and interests in the Arctic region.

### 6. The Crisis Beneath the Achievement: Socio-Economic Disparities

Despite the significant progress made in recognizing Inuit self-governance, Nunavut continues to face profound socio-economic challenges. The territory has the highest suicide rate in Canada, a severe housing shortage, and alarming rates of food insecurity. The cost of living in Nunavut is exorbitant, with basic necessities like food and housing often unaffordable for many residents. The tuberculosis rate is approximately 300 times the national average, reflecting the persistent health disparities in the territory.

These challenges raise critical ethical questions about the adequacy of resources provided to Nunavut by the Canadian government. Some argue that Canada created Nunavut to fulfill a political obligation while deliberately underfunding it, setting the territory up for failure. As Jack Hicks and others have documented, the funding formulas used to allocate resources to Nunavut have consistently fallen short of meeting the territory's needs.

Self-governance without adequate resources is a hollow victory. The Canadian government has a moral obligation to address the socio-economic disparities in Nunavut and ensure that Inuit communities have the resources they need to thrive.

### 7. Conclusion: A Work in Progress

The creation of Nunavut and the recognition of Inuit self-governance represent a significant ethical achievement in Canadian history. However, this achievement is far from complete. The legacy of historical injustices, the ongoing socio-economic crises, and the emerging challenges of Arctic sovereignty and climate change demand continued attention and action.

The principles of *Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit* offer a valuable framework for guiding decision-making and promoting ethical governance in Nunavut. However, the successful implementation of these principles requires a commitment to reconciliation, equitable resource allocation, and genuine partnership between the Canadian government and Inuit communities. The story of Nunavut is a work in progress, a testament to the resilience and determination of the Inuit people, and a challenge to Canada to live up to its ethical obligations.

### **Indigenous Ethical Traditions: The Foundational Layer of Canadian Thought**  

Canada’s intellectual and ethical history does not begin with European contact—it is rooted in the diverse and sophisticated traditions of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples. These ethical systems persist, resist colonial erasure, and are actively revitalized today. Below is a grounded analysis of key traditions, resisting pan-Indigenous generalization while highlighting specific nations, thinkers, and frameworks.

### **1. Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Ethical Traditions**  
**Great Law of Peace (Kaianere'kó:wa)** – A constitutional and ethical framework predating European contact, governing the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, later Tuscarora). Key principles:  
- **Clan Mother System**: Women (Jigonhsasee, the "Mother of Nations") hold authority to appoint and remove chiefs, ensuring leadership accountability.  
- **Seventh Generation Principle**: Decisions must consider impacts seven generations ahead—an early sustainability ethic.  
- **Two Row Wampum (Guswenta, 1613)**: A treaty belt symbolizing parallel sovereignty between Haudenosaunee and Europeans—two paths, non-interference, mutual respect.  

**Ethical Architecture**:  
- **Condolence Ceremony**: Restores balance after harm, emphasizing reconciliation over punishment.  
- **Requirement of Consensus**: No decision imposed without full agreement, contrasting with European majoritarian rule.  

**Key Thinkers & Documents**:  
- **Deganawidah (The Peacemaker)** and **Hiawatha** – Architects of the Great Law.  
- **Jigonhsasee** – The first Clan Mother, embodying ethical governance.  
- **The Silver Covenant Chain** – A diplomatic tradition reinforcing mutual respect in treaty-making.

**Wahkohtowin** – The foundational Cree concept that all beings are related, imposing ethical obligations of care.  
- **Treaty 6 (1876)**: Mistahi-maskwa (Big Bear) resisted signing, foreseeing broken promises—later proven right by famine and betrayal.

- **North-West Resistance (1885)**: A last stand against Canadian expansionism.  
- **Riel’s Trial & Execution (1885)**: An ethical crisis—Canada chose colonial violence over justice.

### **Conclusion: Ethical Traditions as Living Resistance**  
These frameworks were not "replaced" by European thought—they persist in land claims (Delgamuukw v. BC, 1997), UNDRIP implementation (2016), and modern Indigenous governance. Canada’s ethical tradition is defined by the tension between these foundational systems and colonial violence—a gap that must be confronted.  

**Key Sources for Further Study**:  
- *The Mishomis Book* (Edward Benton-Banai, 1988) – Anishinaabe teachings.  
- *The Righteous Mind* (John Borrows, 2010) – Indigenous legal philosophy.  
- *Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit: What Inuit Have Always Known to Be True* (Joe Karetak et al., 2017).  

This is not "pre-history" but the first layer of Canadian ethical thought—one that continues to shape the country’s unresolved moral dilemmas.

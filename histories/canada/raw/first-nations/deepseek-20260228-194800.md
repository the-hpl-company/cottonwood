# Indigenous Ethical Foundations of Turtle Island (Canada): A Multi-National Intellectual History

## 1. Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Ethical Architecture
**The Great Law of Peace (Kaianere'ko:wa)** – Codified circa 1142 CE (some oral traditions date earlier), this constitutional document establishes a confederacy of five (later six) nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. Its ethical core is **Skén:nen** (peace), **Karihwí:io** (righteousness), and **Kasatsténshsera** (power). Key provisions:
- **Clan Mother System**: Jigonsaseh (the Peace Queen) established the role of Clan Mothers who hold authority to appoint and remove chiefs, grounded in the principle that "those who give life should guide its course." This represents one of the oldest continuous systems of women's political authority.
- **Seventh Generation Principle**: Embedded in the law's requirement that leaders consider the impact of decisions on "the unborn faces beneath the ground" seven generations forward. This creates a temporal ethics of intergenerational responsibility.
- **Two Row Wampum (Guswenta, 1613)**: A specific treaty belt of purple shells with two parallel rows of white, representing the Haudenosaunee and European vessels traveling the river of life together, neither steering the other's vessel. This establishes the ethical framework of parallel sovereignty, mutual non-interference, and treaty as relationship.
- **Condolence Ceremony**: The constitutional process for replacing chiefs, emphasizing grief, healing, and continuity—an ethics of political restoration.

## 2. Anishinaabe Ethical System
**Seven Grandfather Teachings** – Originating from the migration story recorded on birch bark scrolls, these are not mere virtues but interconnected obligations:
1. **Nbwaakaawin** (Wisdom): Knowing through lived experience and dream teachings
2. **Zaagidwin** (Love): Unconditional care extending to all creation
3. **Mnaadendimowin** (Respect): Recognition of inherent spirit in all beings
4. **Aakde'ewin** (Bravery): Moral courage to defend the vulnerable
5. **Gwayakwaadiziwin** (Honesty): Integrity in word and relationship
6. **Dbaadendiziwin** (Humility): Understanding one's place within creation
7. **Debwewin** (Truth): Fidelity to reality and oral tradition

**Midewiwin Society** – The Grand Medicine Society, documented in the 1830s by Kahkewaquonaby (Peter Jones) but dating back centuries earlier, serves as an ethical institution preserving knowledge through initiation degrees. Its scrolls encode migration routes and ethical obligations.

**Mino-bimaadiziwin** – The "good life" or "continuous rebirth" is not individual flourishing but maintaining right relationships with all beings. As Anishinaabe scholar **Leanne Betasamosake Simpson** writes in *Dancing on Our Turtle's Back* (2011), this is "a system of ethics that guides our interactions" with land as kin.

## 3. Cree Ethical Framework
**Wahkohtowin** – The Cree law of kinship and relatedness that structures all ethical obligations. As Cree legal scholar **Harold Cardinal** articulated in *The Unjust Society* (1969), this is the foundation that Canadian law violated: "We do not want the Indian Act retained because it is a good piece of legislation. It isn't. It is discriminatory from start to finish."

**Animal-Human Covenant**: In Cree cosmology, animals give themselves to hunters through **pimâtisiwin** (life energy) only when treated with respect. The **nithiyowewin** (Cree language) contains specific grammatical structures that encode animacy and relationship.

**Named Thinkers**: 
- **Big Bear (Mistahimaskwa)** – His resistance to Treaty 6's famine clauses (1876-1882) was an ethical stand against the destruction of wahkohtowin.
- **Harold Cardinal** – His 1969 work coined "the unjust society" as counterpoint to Trudeau's "just society," arguing for treaty-based ethical relationships.
- **Willie Ermine** – Contemporary Cree scholar developing **ethical space** theory for cross-cultural engagement.

## 4. Inuit Ethical Systems
**Inuuqatigiitsiarniq** – Respecting others through relationships, caring for people. This is not abstract but practical Arctic survival ethics: sharing food, children, and namesakes as social security.

**Piliriqatigiinniq** – Working together for a common cause, exemplified in communal seal hunts where distribution follows need, not contribution.

**Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ)** – Formalized in the 1998 *Nunavut Social Development Council Report*, these principles guide Nunavut governance:
1. **Pijitsirniq**: Serving and providing for family/community
2. **Aajiiqatigiinniq**: Decision-making through consensus
3. **Pilimmaksarniq**: Skills and knowledge acquisition
4. **Piliriqatigiinniq**: Collaborative relationships
5. **Avatimik Kamattiarniq**: Environmental stewardship
6. **Qanuqtuurunnarniq**: Resourcefulness and adaptability

**Arctic Ethical Specificity**: The land (**nuna**) is not territory but life-giver. As Inuk scholar **Pitseolak Pfeifer** notes, "In the Arctic, ethical failure means death—not just individual death, but community collapse." This creates an ethics of immediate consequence.

## 5. Métis Ethical Synthesis
**Distinct Nationhood**: The Métis emerge not as "mixed" but as new nation with distinct ethics combining Cree/Ojibwe wahkohtowin and French-Canadian/Catholic communitarianism.

**Louis Riel's Ethical Vision**: His 1885 trial speeches reveal not rebellion but constitutional ethics: "My people will sleep for one hundred years, but when they awake, it will be the artists who give them their spirit back." His resistance was for the **Métis List of Rights** (1869) – a constitutional document demanding representative government, bilingualism, and land rights.

**The Manitoba Act (1870)**: Section 31's 1.4 million acre land grant was an ethical recognition of Métis territory, though systematically violated through scrip fraud.

**Métis Ethical Concepts**:
- **Wahkootowin** (Métis adaptation): Extended kinship including both Indigenous and settler relations
- **La loi de la prairie**: Customary law regulating buffalo hunts with elected captains and strict sharing rules
- **Riel's Mystical Catholicism**: His fusion of Catholic social teaching with Indigenous sovereignty created a unique liberation theology

## 6. Medicine Wheel as Ethical Framework
**Nation-Specific Variations**:

*Blackfoot (Siksikaitsitapi)*: **Ksahkommapiiksi** (the four directions) represent stages of life, seasons, and medicines. As **Leroy Little Bear** explains in *Jagged Worldviews Colliding* (2000), the wheel encodes "a universe of relationships" where ethics emerges from maintaining balance between all sectors.

*Lakota (in Canadian prairies)*: The **Čhaŋnúŋpa** (sacred pipe) ceremony uses the wheel's four directions for prayers, with black (west) representing hardship and introspection as ethical necessity.

*Coastal Nations*: The wheel often includes maritime directions and creatures. Tsimshian ethics use four crest animals in potlatch distributions, creating obligations through gift, not accumulation.

*Anishinaabe*: The **Medicine Wheel Teachings** vary by community but commonly place humility in the north (white), honesty in the east (yellow), respect in the south (red), and courage in the west (black), with truth at the center.

**Resisting Pan-Indigenous Flattening**: As **Glen Coulthard** (Yellowknives Dene) argues in *Red Skin, White Masks* (2014), "The medicine wheel marketed in airports bears little resemblance to the specific grounded ethical systems of particular nations." True understanding requires nation-specific study.

## 7. Key Contemporary Scholars
**Vine Deloria Jr.** (Standing Rock Sioux) – Though American, his *God Is Red* (1973) fundamentally shaped Canadian Indigenous thought by arguing Indigenous religions are place-based ethical systems, contrasting with Christianity's historical linearity.

**Taiaiake Alfred** (Mohawk) – In *Peace, Power, Righteousness* (1999), he revitalizes Kaianere'ko:wa ethics as "Indigenous constitutionalism" against the "white possessive" of Canadian law.

**Leanne Betasamosake Simpson** (Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg) – Her *As We Have Always Done* (2017) develops "constellations of co-resistance" as ethical practice grounded in mino-bimaadiziwin.

**John Borrows** (Anishinaabe) – His *Canada's Indigenous Constitution* (2010) documents how Indigenous legal traditions remain living ethical systems, citing specific teachings from elders like **Maggie Paul** (Wolastoqey) on river relationships.

## Ethical Throughlines
These diverse systems share core ethical orientations that persist despite colonization:

1. **Relationality over individualism**: Ethics emerges from relationships, not abstract principles
2. **Land as ethical teacher**: Specific places hold specific teachings (e.g., the Niagara Escarpment for Haudenosaunee)
3. **Orality as ethical method**: Stories carry ethical weight equal to written codes
4. **Reciprocity as obligation**: Giving creates binding relationships, not transactions
5. **Dream/vision as ethical source**: Non-waking consciousness provides ethical guidance

As the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Call to Action #50** (2015) acknowledges, these systems are not historical artifacts but "Indigenous law and legal traditions" requiring contemporary application. Their revitalization represents what **Leroy Little Bear** calls "ethical renaissance" – not return to past, but application of enduring principles to present challenges.

### **Indigenous Ethical Traditions of Turtle Island (What Is Now Canada): Foundational Frameworks of Harm, Care, and Stewardship**

Canada’s ethical traditions do not begin with European contact or Confederation. They are rooted in millennia of Indigenous thought—philosophies of relationality, reciprocity, and responsibility that persist despite colonial disruption. These traditions are not relics of a "pre-history" but living systems of governance, law, and morality that continue to shape resistance, resurgence, and treaty relationships today.

Below, we trace the ethical architectures of five major Indigenous traditions, resisting pan-Indigenous generalization by naming specific nations, thinkers, and documents. These frameworks are not merely "cultural" but **legal, political, and spiritual**—they define obligations between people, land, and future generations.

## **1. Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Ethics: The Great Law of Peace and the Architecture of Consent**
**Territory:** Southern Ontario, Quebec, and the northeastern U.S. (Six Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, Tuscarora).

### **The Great Law of Peace (Kaianere’ko:wa, ~1142 CE)**
The **Kaianere’ko:wa** is one of the oldest **constitutional democracies** in the world, predating European contact by centuries. It establishes a **confederacy of nations** bound by mutual respect, consensus-based governance, and the **clan mother system**—a matrilineal structure where women hold the authority to select and remove chiefs.

#### **Key Ethical Principles:**
- **The Seventh Generation Principle**
  - Decisions must consider their impact **seven generations into the future** (*Skén:nen Aonkwehshón:a*).
  - Example: The **Two Row Wampum (Guswenta, 1613)**—a treaty with the Dutch (later the British)—establishes **parallel sovereignty**: two vessels (a Haudenosaunee canoe and a European ship) traveling the same river, neither interfering with the other. This is not just a political agreement but an **ethical framework** for non-interference and mutual respect.
  - **Citation:** The **Two Row Wampum** is still invoked in modern treaty negotiations (e.g., the **Haldimand Proclamation, 1784**, which granted the Six Nations land along the Grand River).

- **The Clan Mother System**
  - Women hold the **title to land** and the authority to **appoint and remove chiefs** (*Royaneh*).
  - This ensures **accountability**—leaders who act unjustly can be deposed.
  - **Ethical implication:** Power is **not hierarchical** but **relational**, rooted in the consent of the people.

- **The Condolence Ceremony (At the Wood’s Edge)**
  - A ritual for **restoring balance** after conflict, emphasizing **collective healing** over punishment.
  - **Ethical implication:** Harm is not met with retribution but with **restoration of relationships**.

- **The Dish with One Spoon (Gdoo-naaganinaa, pre-contact)**
  - A treaty between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe nations establishing **shared stewardship** of the land.
  - **Ethical principle:** The land is a **commons**, not property—hunting and gathering must be done **without greed**, leaving enough for others.
  - **Modern relevance:** Cited in **land-back movements** (e.g., **1492 Land Back Lane, 2020**).

#### **Key Thinkers & Documents:**
- **Dekanawida (The Great Peacemaker)** – Legendary founder of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
- **Jake Thomas (Onondaga)** – Keeper of the **Wampum Belts**, which encode the Great Law.
- **Audra Simpson (Mohawk)** – Scholar of **Haudenosaunee sovereignty** (*Mohawk Interruptus*, 2014).
- **The Haldimand Proclamation (1784)** – Recognizes Six Nations land rights (later violated by Canada).
- **The Jay Treaty (1794)** – Affirms Haudenosaunee right to **cross the U.S.-Canada border freely** (still contested today).

## **2. Anishinaabe Ethics: The Seven Grandfather Teachings and Mino-Bimaadiziwin**
**Territory:** The Great Lakes region, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, parts of Quebec and Ontario (Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Mississaugas, Nipissing).

### **The Seven Grandfather Teachings (Nbwaakaawin, Zaagidwin, Mnaadendimowin, etc.)**
These teachings are **not just moral guidelines** but **legal and spiritual obligations** passed down through **oral tradition, ceremony, and the Midewiwin (Grand Medicine Society)**.

| **Teaching** | **Meaning** | **Ethical Application** |
|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Nbwaakaawin (Wisdom)** | To cherish knowledge | Decisions must be made with **long-term understanding**, not short-term gain. |
| **Zaagidwin (Love)** | To know peace | **Unconditional care** for all beings—humans, animals, land. |
| **Mnaadendimowin (Respect)** | To honor all creation | **Reciprocity**—taking only what you need, giving back. |
| **Aakde’ewin (Bravery)** | To face the foe with integrity | Standing up for **justice**, even at personal cost. |
| **Gwayakwaadiziwin (Honesty)** | To be truthful in word and action | **Transparency** in governance and relationships. |
| **Dbaadendiziwin (Humility)** | To know oneself as part of creation | **No one is above the land or the community.** |
| **Debwewin (Truth)** | To live in accordance with reality | **Rejecting deception**, including colonial narratives. |

### **Mino-Bimaadiziwin (The Good Life)**
- The **ultimate ethical goal**—living in **balance** with all relations.
- **Not individualistic**—it is **collective well-being**, dependent on **right relationships** with land, ancestors, and future generations.
- **Example:** The **Anishinaabe prophecy of the Seven Fires** warns of colonial destruction but also foretells a time of **revitalization** if people return to mino-bimaadiziwin.

### **The Midewiwin (Grand Medicine Society)**
- A **spiritual and ethical institution** that preserves Anishinaabe law.
- **Not just "medicine"**—it is a **system of governance, education, and conflict resolution**.
- **Ethical role:** Ensures that **harm is addressed through ceremony and restoration**, not punishment.

#### **Key Thinkers & Documents:**
- **Basil Johnston (Ojibwe)** – *Ojibway Heritage* (1976), *The Manitous* (1995).
- **Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg)** – *Dancing on Our Turtle’s Back* (2011), *As We Have Always Done* (2017).
- **Eddie Benton-Banai (Ojibwe)** – *The Mishomis Book* (1988), a foundational text on Anishinaabe worldview.
- **The Robinson Treaties (1850)** – Early treaties where Anishinaabe leaders **explicitly retained hunting and fishing rights** (later violated).
- **The Williams Treaties (1923)** – A **fraudulent** land surrender that led to **decades of legal battles** (finally settled in **2018**).

## **3. Cree Ethics: Wahkohtowin (Kinship as Law)**
**Territory:** Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Northwest Territories (Nehiraw, Nehiyawak).

### **Wahkohtowin (All My Relations)**
- The **foundational ethical concept**—**everything is related**.
- **Not just a metaphor**: It is a **legal and spiritual obligation** to act with **care for all beings** (humans, animals, rivers, rocks).
- **Example:** The **Cree concept of "maskihkiya"** (medicine) is not just plants—it is **the relationship between the plant and the person**, the **gratitude and reciprocity** in taking it.

### **Ethical Obligations to Land and Animals**
- **Hunting is not "resource extraction"**—it is a **sacred relationship**.
- **Example:** The **Cree protocol of "miyo-wîcêhtowin"** (having good relations) requires **asking permission** before taking from the land.
- **Violation of wahkohtowin = harm to the community.**
  - **Example:** Overhunting is not just "bad management"—it is a **moral failing** that disrupts balance.

### **Key Thinkers & Documents:**
- **Harold Cardinal (Cree)** – *The Unjust Society* (1969), a **scathing critique** of Canada’s treatment of Indigenous peoples.
  - **Key argument:** Canada’s **Indian Act (1876)** is **not just assimilationist—it is a violation of wahkohtowin**, breaking kinship ties.
- **Winona Wheeler (Cree)** – Scholar of **Cree intellectual traditions** and **oral history**.
- **The Numbered Treaties (1871-1921)**
  - **Treaty 6 (1876)** includes the **"medicine chest clause"**—a promise of healthcare (later used to argue for **Jordan’s Principle**, 2016).
  - **Treaty 8 (1899)** was signed under **false pretenses**—Cree leaders were told they could **keep hunting and fishing**, but Canada later **criminalized it**.
- **The Delgamuukw Decision (1997)** – Recognizes **Aboriginal title** as a **collective right**, rooted in **Indigenous law** (including wahkohtowin).

## **4. Inuit Ethics: Inuuqatigiitsiarniq and Piliriqatigiinniq (Respect and Collective Action)**
**Territory:** Inuit Nunangat (Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Northern Quebec, Labrador).

### **Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) – "That Which Has Long Been Known"**
A **formalized ethical framework** now used in **Nunavut governance**, IQ includes:

| **Principle** | **Meaning** | **Ethical Application** |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Inuuqatigiitsiarniq** | Respecting others, relationships, and caring for people | **Harm is relational**—disrespect harms the community. |
| **Piliriqatigiinniq** | Working together for a common cause | **Collective survival** in the Arctic requires **interdependence**. |
| **Aajiiqatigiinniq** | Decision-making through discussion and consensus | **No hierarchy**—leaders must **listen to the community**. |
| **Pijitsirniq** | Serving and providing for family, community, or both | **Leadership is service**, not power. |
| **Qanuqtuurniq** | Being innovative and resourceful | **Adaptability** is an ethical necessity in the Arctic. |
| **Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq** | Respect and care for the land, animals, and environment | **Hunting is a sacred duty**, not exploitation. |

### **How Arctic Living Shapes Ethical Obligation**
- **Survival depends on reciprocity**—sharing food, shelter, and knowledge is **not charity but necessity**.
- **Example:** The **Inuit practice of "nalliuti"** (sharing meat) ensures **no one goes hungry**.
- **Colonial disruption:** **Forced relocation** (e.g., **High Arctic Relocation, 1953-55**) **violated inuuqatigiitsiarniq**, separating families and communities.

### **Key Thinkers & Documents:**
- **Zebedee Nungak (Inuk)** – *Wrestling with Colonialism on Steroids* (2017), on **Inuit resistance to Quebec’s James Bay hydro project**.
- **Sheila Watt-Cloutier (Inuk)** – *The Right to Be Cold* (2015), on **climate change as a human rights issue**.
- **The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (1993)** – The **largest Indigenous land claim in Canadian history**, establishing **Inuit self-governance**.
- **The Inuit Circumpolar Council (1977)** – A **pan-Arctic Indigenous organization** advocating for **Inuit rights**.

## **5. Métis Ethics: The Distinct Nation and the Prophetic Resistance of Louis Riel**
**Territory:** The Métis Nation Homeland (Red River, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, parts of Ontario, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories).

### **Métis as an Ethical Synthesis**
- The Métis Nation is **not "half-Indigenous, half-European"**—it is a **distinct Indigenous people** with its own **language (Michif), laws, and governance**.
- **Ethical foundation:** **Wahkohtowin (Cree kinship) + French Catholic social teaching + Indigenous trade networks**.

### **Louis Riel: Prophet, Statesman, Martyr**
- **Not just a "rebel"**—Riel was a **Métis intellectual, spiritual leader, and founder of Manitoba**.
- **The Red River Resistance (1869-70)**
  - **Ethical demand:** **Métis land rights must be recognized**—Canada could not simply **annex Rupert’s Land** without Métis consent.
  - **Result:** The **Manitoba Act (1870)**, which **guaranteed Métis land rights** (later **stolen through scrip fraud**).
- **The North-West Resistance (1885)**
  - **Ethical crisis:** Canada **violated the Manitoba Act**, leading to **Métis starvation and dispossession**.
  - Riel’s **trial and execution (1885)** was a **colonial show trial**—he was **denied a fair hearing** and **hanged for treason**.
  - **Ethical legacy:** Riel is a **symbol of Indigenous resistance**—his last words: *"I am more convinced every day that without a single exception I did right."*

### **Métis Legal and Ethical Traditions**
- **The Métis Nation’s "Laws of the Hunt"** – **Collective land stewardship**, not private property.
- **The "Road Allowance People"** – Métis who were **pushed to the margins** of settler society, living on **road allowances** (public land).
- **The Daniels Decision (2016)** – **Legally recognizes Métis as "Indians" under the Constitution**, affirming **federal responsibility**.

#### **Key Thinkers & Documents:**
- **Louis Riel** – *The Collected Writings of Louis Riel* (1985).
- **Maria Campbell (Métis)** – *Halfbreed* (1973), a **foundational memoir** on Métis identity and resistance.
- **The Manitoba Act (1870)** – **Canada’s first constitutional recognition of Indigenous land rights** (later betrayed).
- **The Powley Decision (2003)** – Recognizes **Métis hunting rights** under **section 35 of the Constitution**.

## **6. The Medicine Wheel as Ethical Framework (With Specificity)**
The **medicine wheel** is **not a single, pan-Indigenous symbol**—it is used differently by different nations.

| **Nation** | **Medicine Wheel Interpretation** | **Ethical Application** |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Lakota (Sioux)** | **Four directions, four races, four stages of life** | **Balance between all peoples and life stages.** |
| **Blackfoot (Siksika)** | **Four seasons, four sacred medicines (sage, sweetgrass, tobacco, cedar)** | **Healing is cyclical, not linear.** |
| **Anishinaabe** | **Four parts of self (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual)** | **Personal and collective well-being require all four.** |
| **Cree** | **Four elements (earth, water, fire, air)** | **Harm to one element harms all.** |

**Ethical principle:** **Balance is not static—it requires constant adjustment.**
- **Example:** The **Anishinaabe "Four Hills of Life"** (childhood, youth, adulthood, elderhood) teach that **each stage has its own responsibilities**.
- **Colonial disruption:** **Residential schools** **broke the medicine wheel** by **separating children from elders**, disrupting the **transmission of knowledge**.

### **Black Canadian Ethical Tradition: Resistance, Broken Promises, and the Fight for Justice**  

The Black Canadian intellectual and ethical tradition is not a footnote to the American story but a distinct thread of resistance, survival, and moral reckoning within Canada’s history. From the broken promises to Black Loyalists to contemporary anti-Black policing, this tradition exposes the myth of Canadian benevolence while asserting a persistent demand for justice.  

#### **1. The Underground Railroad and Black Loyalists: Broken Promises (1783–1792)**  
After the American Revolution, approximately **3,500 Black Loyalists** were evacuated to Nova Scotia, documented in the **Book of Negroes (1783)**—a British ledger listing Black refugees who had fought for the Crown. Many settled in **Birchtown, NS**, which briefly became the largest free Black community in North America.  

Yet the British reneged on land and provisions. Black settlers received **inferior, rocky plots** compared to white Loyalists, and faced **delayed supplies** and **racial violence** (Walker, *Race on Trial*, 2008). By **1792**, **1,200 Black Loyalists** left for Sierra Leone, rejecting Canada’s false promises (Clairmont & Magill, *Nova Scotia’s Black Loyalists*, 1999).  

#### **2. Slavery in Canada: The Cooley Incident and Partial Abolition (1793)**  
Slavery existed in **New France** (under the **Code Noir**) and British North America. In **1793**, **Chloe Cooley**, an enslaved Black woman in Upper Canada, resisted violently as she was bound and sold across the Niagara River. Her case spurred **Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe** to pass the **Act Against Slavery (1793)**—the **first anti-slavery law in the British Empire**.  

However, the law **only banned new imports**—existing enslaved people remained in bondage. Full abolition did not come until **1834** with the **Slavery Abolition Act** (British Parliament).  

#### **3. Africville: Environmental Racism and Forced Displacement (1848–1970)**  
Established by descendants of War of 1812 refugees, **Africville (Halifax)** was systematically denied **water, sewage, and paved roads** while the city placed a **dump, prison, and infectious disease hospital** beside it (Nelson, *Razing Africville*, 2008).  

In **1964–1970**, Halifax demolished Africville, forcibly relocating residents in **city dump trucks**. The **2010 apology** and **Africville Heritage Trust** remain contested—symbolic reparations without land return (Clairmont, *Africville: The Life and Death of a Canadian Black Community*, 1987).  

#### **4. The Colored Corps and Military Service: Fighting for a Country That Oppressed Them**  
Despite systemic racism, Black Canadians served in segregated units:  
- **No. 2 Construction Battalion (1916–1920)**, the only all-Black unit in WWI, was barred from combat and given menial labour (Ruck, *The Black Battalion*, 1987).  
- In WWII, Black soldiers still faced discrimination, though some units (like the **Toronto Railway Patrol**) were integrated under pressure (Walker, *"Race," Rights and the Law*, 1997).  

The ethical dilemma: **Why fight for a country that denies your humanity?**  

#### **5. The Sir George Williams Affair (1969): Campus Uprising Against Racism**  
At **Sir George Williams University (now Concordia)**, Black students occupied the computer centre to protest a professor’s **racist grading practices**. The administration called police, who **brutally arrested 97 protesters**—many Black. A **fire broke out**, destroying the centre (Austin, *Fear of a Black Nation*, 2013).  

The affair exposed **institutional racism in Canadian universities** and the **criminalization of Black dissent**.  

#### **6. Contemporary Anti-Blackness: Denial as a Canadian Tradition**  
- **Andrew Loku (2015)**: A Black man shot by Toronto police within **30 seconds** of their arrival—no charges.  
- **Carding/Street Checks**: Toronto police’s **disproportionate targeting** of Black men (Maynard, *Policing Black Lives*, 2017).  
- **Desmond Cole (2017)**: Resigned from the *Toronto Star* after being censored for his activism against carding (*The Skin We’re In*, 2020).  

Canadian anti-Blackness thrives on **denial**: "We’re not like America" as a shield against accountability.  

#### **7. Key Thinkers and Texts**  
- **Afua Cooper** (*The Hanging of Angélique*, 2006): Exposes slavery in New France.  
- **Barrington Walker** (*Race on Trial*, 2008): Legal history of Black Canadians.  
- **Rinaldo Walcott** (*Black Like Who?*, 2003): Challenges Canadian multicultural myths.  
- **Dionne Brand** (*A Map to the Door of No Return*, 2001): Black diasporic memory in Canada.  

### **Conclusion: A Tradition of Resistance and Ethical Reckoning**  
The Black Canadian ethical tradition is one of **survival, refusal, and unyielding demand for justice**—against a state that denies its own violence. From **Birchtown to Africville, from Chloe Cooley to Desmond Cole**, this history demands Canada confront its **anti-Brack foundations**, not hide behind myths of politeness.

This is not a parallel to the U.S.—it is Canada’s own story of harm and resistance.

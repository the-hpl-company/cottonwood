### **The Black Canadian Ethical Tradition: A Distinct Thread in Canadian Intellectual History**

The Black Canadian ethical tradition is not a footnote to the American experience but a distinct intellectual and moral lineage shaped by resistance, resilience, and the struggle for justice within Canada’s own systems of oppression. This tradition emerges from a history of broken promises, legal contradictions, and persistent anti-Black racism—one that is often obscured by the myth of Canada as a benevolent "northern refuge." Below, we trace its key ethical tensions, achievements, and failures through specific events, legislation, and intellectual contributions.

### **1. The Underground Railroad and Black Loyalists: Broken Promises and the Ethics of Refuge**
The arrival of **3,500 Black Loyalists** in Nova Scotia (1783–1785) after the American Revolution was framed as an act of British benevolence. The **Book of Negroes** (1783), a British naval ledger, documented their evacuation from New York, listing names, ages, and former enslavers—an early record of Black agency in seeking freedom. Yet the reality in Nova Scotia was one of betrayal.

- **Birchtown, Nova Scotia**, became the largest free Black settlement in North America, but the land granted was rocky and infertile. Promised provisions arrived late or not at all. The **Sierra Leone Company’s offer of relocation** (1792) led **1,200 Black Loyalists** to leave Canada for West Africa, a searing indictment of the conditions they faced.
- **Ethical tension:** The British Crown’s rhetoric of liberation clashed with its failure to provide material justice. The exodus to Sierra Leone was both an act of self-determination and a forced choice—proof that Canada was not the promised land it claimed to be.

### **2. Slavery in Canada: Legal Contradictions and Resistance**
Canada’s history of slavery is often erased in national narratives, but it was legally entrenched in **New France** under the **Code Noir (1685)**, which regulated the treatment of enslaved Africans and Indigenous people. Slavery persisted in British North America until its gradual abolition in the 19th century.

- **The Chloe Cooley Incident (1793):** An enslaved woman in Upper Canada was violently bound and sold across the Niagara River. Her resistance led Lieutenant Governor **John Graves Simcoe** to introduce the **Act Against Slavery (1793)**, the first anti-slavery legislation in the British Empire. However, the law was **compromised**: it banned new importation of enslaved people but **grandfathered existing enslavement**, ensuring that those already in bondage remained so.
- **Ethical tension:** The Act was a partial victory—proof that Black resistance could force legal change—but it also revealed the limits of Canadian abolitionism. Unlike the U.S., Canada did not have a Civil War over slavery, but its legal system still **perpetuated racial hierarchy**.

### **3. Africville: Environmental Racism and the Ethics of Dispossession**
**Africville (1848–1970)**, a Black community in Halifax, was established by descendants of refugees from the **War of 1812**. Despite paying taxes, residents were **denied basic municipal services**—no running water, sewage, or paved roads—while the city built a **dump, a prison, and an infectious disease hospital** adjacent to the neighborhood.

- **Forced Displacement (1964–1970):** Under the guise of "urban renewal," Africville was demolished. Residents were **relocated in city dump trucks**, their homes bulldozed. The **Africville Apology (2010)** and the establishment of the **Africville Heritage Trust** were belated acknowledgments of this **ethical catastrophe**.
- **Ethical tension:** Africville was not an accident but a **deliberate policy of environmental racism**, where Black lives were deemed expendable. The apology, while necessary, could not undo the **intergenerational trauma** of displacement.

### **4. The Colored Corps and Military Service: Fighting for a Country That Discriminates**
Black Canadians have served in every major conflict, yet their contributions were met with **systemic racism**.

- **The Colored Corps (War of 1812):** A militia of free Black men who fought at the **Battle of Queenston Heights**, proving their loyalty despite being denied equal pay.
- **No. 2 Construction Battalion (WWI, 1916):** The only all-Black unit in Canadian military history, tasked with non-combat labor despite their desire to fight. Their service was **erased from official narratives** for decades.
- **Ethical tension:** Black soldiers fought for a country that **denied them full citizenship**. Their service exposed the **hypocrisy of Canadian democracy**—a theme that persists in debates over police violence and carding today.

### **5. The Sir George Williams Affair (1969): Campus Protest and Institutional Racism**
In **1969**, Black students at **Sir George Williams University (now Concordia)** occupied the computer center to protest a professor’s **racist grading practices**. The administration’s inaction led to a **14-day standoff**, culminating in a **police raid and a fire** that destroyed the computer center.

- **Ethical dimensions:** The protest was a **defining moment in Canadian Black activism**, exposing the **institutional racism** of universities. The fire was blamed on students, but later evidence suggested **police provocation**.
- **Legacy:** The affair revealed how Canadian institutions **suppress dissent** rather than address systemic racism—a pattern that continues in debates over **university diversity policies** today.

### **6. Contemporary Struggles: Denial as a Canadian Ethical Failure**
Canada’s anti-Black racism is often **denied or minimized** through the myth of "not being like America." Yet recent events reveal its persistence:

- **Andrew Loku (2015):** A South Sudanese refugee was **shot by Toronto police** in his apartment. The **Ontario Coroner’s Inquest (2017)** ruled it a homicide, but no charges were laid.
- **Carding/Street Checks:** A **2018 Ontario Human Rights Commission report** found that Black Torontonians were **20 times more likely** to be carded than white residents.
- **Desmond Cole’s Resignation (2017):** The journalist quit the *Toronto Star* after being **censored for his activism** against carding, exposing the **limits of Canadian media’s racial justice coverage**.

#### **Key Intellectual Contributions:**
- **Austin Clarke** (*The Polished Hoe*, 2002): A novel exposing the **psychological toll of colonialism** on Black Barbadian-Canadian women.
- **Dionne Brand** (*A Map to the Door of No Return*, 2001): A meditation on **Black diasporic memory** and the **violence of Canadian erasure**.
- **Rinaldo Walcott** (*Black Like Who?*, 1997): A critique of **Canadian multiculturalism’s failure** to address anti-Blackness.

### **7. Scholarship: Rewriting Black Canadian History**
The erasure of Black Canadian history has been challenged by scholars who **center Black voices** in Canadian intellectual life:

- **Barrington Walker** (*Race on Trial*, 2010): Examines how **legal systems** have criminalized Blackness in Canada.
- **Afua Cooper** (*The Hanging of Angélique*, 2006): Recovers the story of **Marie-Joseph Angélique**, an enslaved Black woman executed in 1734 for allegedly burning Montreal.
- **Robyn Maynard** (*Policing Black Lives*, 2017): Documents the **state violence** against Black Canadians from slavery to the present.
- **Desmond Cole** (*The Skin We’re In*, 2020): A journalistic expose of **Canadian anti-Black racism**, challenging the myth of racial innocence.

### **Conclusion: The Ethics of Reckoning**
The Black Canadian ethical tradition is one of **resistance to erasure**—a demand that Canada confront its own **legacies of slavery, segregation, and state violence**. Unlike the U.S., where anti-Black racism is often **openly acknowledged (if not addressed)**, Canada’s racism is **denied, minimized, or framed as exceptional**. This **ethical shield**—"We’re not like America"—has allowed systemic injustice to persist.

To truly engage with Black Canadian ethics is to **reject the polite narrative** and instead grapple with:
- The **broken promises** of the Underground Railroad.
- The **legal contradictions** of Canadian abolition.
- The **environmental racism** of Africville.
- The **military’s exclusion** of Black soldiers.
- The **institutional racism** of universities and police.

Only by **centering these histories** can Canada begin to address its **unfinished ethical reckoning** with anti-Blackness.

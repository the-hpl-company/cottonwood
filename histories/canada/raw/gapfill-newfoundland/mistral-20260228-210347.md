### **Newfoundland’s Distinct Ethical Trajectory: A History of Extinction, Exploitation, and Resilience**

Newfoundland’s ethical history is marked by radical discontinuities—colonial violence, economic collapse, democratic surrender, and contested nationhood—all of which challenge Canada’s self-conception as a benevolent federation. Unlike the rest of Canada, Newfoundland was not a settler colony of the British Crown in the same way; it was a fishery-based society that developed its own moral economy before being absorbed into Canada in 1949. Its ethical trajectory is defined by the **Beothuk genocide**, the **cod fishery’s rise and fall**, the **voluntary surrender of democracy**, the **exploitative terms of Confederation**, and the **interprovincial betrayals** that followed. These events force Canada to confront uncomfortable questions: *What does it mean to inherit a history of extinction? How does a society reconcile with economic and political dispossession? And what ethical obligations arise when a nation joins another by the slimmest of margins?*

### **1. The Beothuk: Canada’s First and Only Indigenous Genocide**
The Beothuk, the Indigenous people of Newfoundland, were **extinct as a distinct people by 1829** with the death of Shanawdithit, the last known Beothuk. Their destruction was not an accident of history but the result of **deliberate policies of exclusion, starvation, and violence** by European fishermen and settlers.

#### **The Ethical Catastrophe: Bounties, Captivity, and Erasure**
- **17th–18th centuries:** European fishermen, primarily from England and France, established a **migratory fishery** along Newfoundland’s coast, competing with the Beothuk for resources. Unlike in other parts of Canada, where Indigenous peoples were incorporated into the fur trade, the Beothuk were **actively excluded** from the cod fishery. When they took fish or gear, settlers responded with **violence** (Ingeborg Marshall, *A History and Ethnography of the Beothuk*, 1996).
- **1768:** Governor Hugh Palliser issued a proclamation **banning trade with the Beothuk**, cutting them off from European goods and forcing them inland, where they starved (Marshall, 1996).
- **1819:** The capture of **Demasduit (Mary March)**—a Beothuk woman seized by settlers in an attempt to "civilize" the remaining Beothuk—became a symbol of colonial violence. She died of tuberculosis in 1820, and her husband, Nonosbawsut, was killed resisting her capture. Their infant daughter died shortly after.
- **1823:** The British government offered a **bounty for Beothuk scalps**, though no records confirm if it was claimed (Marshall, 1996).
- **1827:** Shanawdithit, the last known Beothuk, was captured. She provided **ethnographic testimony** to William Cormack, detailing the Beothuk’s systematic displacement and starvation. She died in 1829, marking the **extinction of her people**.

#### **Ethical Implications for Canada**
The Beothuk extinction is **Canada’s only confirmed Indigenous genocide** (Sean Cadigan, *Newfoundland and Labrador: A History*, 2009). Unlike the residential school system or the numbered treaties, which involved **assimilation or displacement**, the Beothuk were **wiped out entirely**. This raises profound ethical questions:
- **Does Canada inherit moral responsibility for a genocide that occurred before Confederation?**
- **How does a nation reconcile with the fact that its oldest colony was built on the erasure of its original inhabitants?**
- **Why is the Beothuk story marginalized in Canadian memory?** (Unlike the Mi’kmaq or Innu, the Beothuk left no descendants to demand justice.)

The **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC, 2015)** did not address the Beothuk, as it focused on survivors of residential schools. However, the **National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019)** acknowledged the Beothuk as victims of **colonial gendered violence**, given that Demasduit’s capture was an act of **sexualized colonial domination**.

### **2. The Cod Fishery as Ethical Framework: 500 Years of Moral Economy**
For nearly **500 years (1497–1992)**, Newfoundland’s society was structured around the **cod fishery**, which shaped its **ethics of labor, community, and survival**.

#### **The Migratory vs. Settled Fishery: Two Ethical Systems**
- **1497:** John Cabot’s voyage marked the beginning of the **migratory fishery**, where European fishermen (mostly English and French) sailed to Newfoundland each summer, salted cod onshore, and returned home. This system **minimized permanent settlement** and **avoided Indigenous displacement** (for a time).
- **17th–18th centuries:** The **settled fishery** emerged as fishermen began overwintering. This led to **conflict with the Beothuk**, as settlers claimed land and resources.
- **18th century:** The **truck system** developed, where merchants (often based in England) **controlled credit, supplies, and prices**, keeping fishermen in **debt peonage**. This created a **moral economy of dependency** (Sean Cadigan, *Hope and Deception in Conception Bay*, 1995).

#### **The Outport Moral Economy: Cooperation and Survival**
Newfoundland’s **outport communities** (small, isolated fishing villages) developed a **distinct ethical framework**:
- **Communal labor:** Fishermen worked in **crew shares**, dividing catch equally.
- **Seasonal time:** Life was structured around the **fishing season**, not industrial clocks.
- **Mutual aid:** The **mercy of the sea** (the constant threat of drowning) fostered **interdependence** (Gerald Sider, *Between History and Tomorrow*, 1986).
- **Resistance to capitalism:** Fishermen **sabotaged merchant scales**, underreported catches, and engaged in **informal barter** to resist exploitation.

This system was **not idyllic**—it was **precarious, hierarchical, and often brutal**—but it represented an **alternative to industrial capitalism**, one that valued **survival over profit**.

### **3. The Cod Moratorium (1992): The Collapse of an Ethical World**
On **July 2, 1992**, Fisheries Minister **John Crosbie** announced the **closure of the northern cod fishery**, putting **40,000 people out of work overnight**—the **largest industrial layoff in Canadian history**.

#### **Who Was Responsible?**
The moratorium was the result of **multiple failures**:
- **Overfishing by Canadian draggers:** The **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** ignored warnings from scientists and fishermen about declining stocks (Dean Bavington, *Managed Annihilation*, 2010).
- **Foreign overfishing:** European and Soviet trawlers **plundered the Grand Banks** in the 1960s–80s, with Canada powerless to stop them (Cadigan, 2009).
- **Federal neglect:** Ottawa **prioritized industrial fishing** over inshore fishermen, leading to **ecological collapse**.
- **DFO science failure:** The **1986 Kirby Report** (commissioned by the federal government) **downplayed the crisis**, allowing overfishing to continue.

#### **Ethical Dimensions: Who Pays for Collapse?**
- **The destruction of outport communities:** Entire villages **disappeared** as people moved to cities for work. The **federal resettlement programs** (1954–1975) had already forced **28,000 people** to abandon their homes; the moratorium **finished the job**.
- **The betrayal of trust:** Fishermen had **followed DFO quotas**, only to be told the fish were gone. Many saw this as **a lie**—that the government had **sacrificed them for corporate profits**.
- **The moral economy shattered:** The cod fishery was not just an industry; it was a **way of life**. Its collapse was an **ethical trauma**, not just an economic one.

#### **Aftermath: The Royal Commission on the Cod Fishery (1992–1993)**
The **Harris Report (1993)** concluded that the moratorium was **inevitable** but criticized the federal government for **failing to prepare for the social fallout**. It recommended:
- **Income support** (which was **inadequate**).
- **Retraining programs** (which **failed** to replace lost livelihoods).
- **A shift to aquaculture** (which **never materialized** at scale).

The moratorium remains a **wound in Newfoundland’s collective memory**, a symbol of **federal neglect and ecological betrayal**.

### **4. Confederation (1949): Joining Canada by 2.3%**
Newfoundland’s entry into Canada was **not a triumph of nation-building but a desperate act of a bankrupt colony**.

#### **The Referendum of 1948: A Nation Divided**
- **June 3, 1948:** First referendum—**three options**:
  1. **Return to responsible government** (44.6%)
  2. **Join Canada** (41.1%)
  3. **Continue Commission of Government** (14.3%)
- **July 22, 1948:** Second referendum—**two options**:
  - **Confederation: 52.3%**
  - **Responsible Government: 47.7%**

The margin was **2.3%**—the **narrowest in Canadian history**. The vote was **deeply regional**:
- **St. John’s and the Avalon Peninsula** (urban, merchant class) **opposed Confederation**.
- **Outports and Labrador** (poorer, dependent on federal aid) **supported it**.

#### **Joey Smallwood and the Campaign for Confederation**
- **Joey Smallwood**, a former radio broadcaster and socialist, **led the Confederate Association**, promising:
  - **Family allowances** (which **immediately improved child poverty rates**).
  - **Old-age pensions** (which **reduced elderly destitution**).
  - **Federal infrastructure funding** (which **modernized roads and hospitals**).
- **The Responsible Government League (RGL)**, led by **Peter Cashin**, argued that Confederation would **destroy Newfoundland’s identity** and make it a **"colony of a colony."**

#### **The Terms of Union: What Newfoundland Gained and Lost**
The **Terms of Union (1949)** were **negotiated in secret** by Smallwood and Ottawa. Key provisions:
- **Article 1:** Newfoundland became Canada’s **10th province**.
- **Article 31:** Canada took over Newfoundland’s **$42 million debt**.
- **Article 37:** Newfoundland kept control of its **natural resources** (unlike other provinces).
- **Article 40:** Canada promised to **maintain Newfoundland’s existing social programs** (a key selling point).

**What Newfoundland lost:**
- **Fiscal autonomy:** Newfoundland had **no control over its own taxes** for years.
- **Cultural identity:** The **Newfoundland flag, anthem, and distinct legal traditions** were **marginalized**.
- **Economic sovereignty:** Future resource deals (like **Churchill Falls**) would be **negotiated from a position of weakness**.

#### **Ethical Implications: Was Confederation a Betrayal?**
- **For Smallwood’s supporters:** Confederation was **salvation**—a way out of poverty.
- **For the RGL:** It was **a surrender of nationhood**—Newfoundland had **given up on itself**.
- **For modern Newfoundlanders:** The debate continues. Some see Confederation as **a necessary evil**; others as **a historic mistake**.

### **5. The Commission of Government (1934–1949): The Only Country to Voluntarily Surrender Democracy**
In 1934, Newfoundland **gave up self-government**—the **only country in the 20th century to voluntarily surrender democracy**.

#### **The Amulree Commission (1933) and the Collapse of Responsible Government**
- **1920s:** Newfoundland was **bankrupt**, having borrowed heavily for **railways and World War I**.
- **1932:** The **Great Depression** destroyed fish prices, and the government **defaulted on its debt**.
- **1933:** The **Amulree Commission** (led by British Lord Amulree) recommended **suspending responsible government** and replacing it with a **British-appointed Commission of Government**.

#### **The Ethical Implications: A Nation That Gave Up on Itself**
- **Why did Newfoundlanders accept this?** Many saw it as **temporary**—a way to **avoid bankruptcy**.
- **Was it colonialism?** Yes. The Commission was **unelected**, and Newfoundland had **no say in its own governance**.
- **Did it work?** Economically, **no**—the Commission **failed to revive the fishery**. Politically, it **eroded Newfoundland’s national identity**.

#### **The Path to Confederation**
By 1948, Newfoundland had **three options**:
1. **Return to responsible government** (but with no money).
2. **Join Canada** (and get federal aid).
3. **Stay under Commission rule** (which no one wanted).

The **narrow vote for Confederation** reflected **desperation, not enthusiasm**.

### **6. Churchill Falls (1969) and Muskrat Falls: Interprovincial Exploitation**
Newfoundland’s **worst economic deals** have come **not from Ottawa, but from Quebec**.

#### **Churchill Falls (1969): The Deal That Haunts Newfoundland**
- **1969:** Newfoundland signed a **65-year contract** with Hydro-Québec to sell power from the **Churchill Falls hydroelectric project** at **1969 prices** (less than **0.3 cents per kWh**).
- **2024:** Quebec still pays **the same rate**, while market prices are **over 10 cents per kWh**.
- **Newfoundland’s loss:** **$100+ billion** in revenue over the life of the contract.
- **Why did it happen?** Newfoundland was **desperate for cash** and **had no leverage** against Quebec.

#### **Muskrat Falls (2017): A Failed Correction**
- **2017:** Newfoundland tried to **bypass Quebec** by building the **Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project** and selling power directly to Nova Scotia.
- **Problems:**
  - **Cost overruns** (from $6.2 billion to **$13 billion**).
  - **Methylmercury contamination** in **Labrador Inuit** lands (violating **Article 29 of the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement, 2005**).
  - **Federal bailout (2021):** Ottawa took over the project, **saddling Newfoundland with debt**.

#### **Ethical Dimensions: Exploitation Within Confederation**
- **Churchill Falls** is **Canada’s most lopsided interprovincial deal**—a **betrayal of federalism’s promise of fairness**.
- **Muskrat Falls** shows how **Newfoundland’s desperation** leads to **self-inflicted wounds**.
- **The federal government’s role:** Ottawa **did not intervene** in Churchill Falls, and **only bailed out Muskrat Falls when it was too late**.

### **Conclusion: Newfoundland’s Ethical Legacy for Canada**
Newfoundland’s history forces Canada to confront **uncomfortable truths**:
1. **Extinction is part of Canada’s founding.** The Beothuk genocide is **not a footnote** but a **central ethical failure**.
2. **Economic collapse can be an ethical trauma.** The cod moratorium was **not just a policy failure** but a **moral betrayal**.
3. **Democracy is fragile.** Newfoundland **gave up self-government**—a warning about **what happens when a society loses faith in itself**.
4. **Confederation is not always a happy story.** Newfoundland joined Canada **by a 2.3% margin**—a **divided, reluctant union**.
5. **Federalism can be exploitative.** Churchill Falls is **Canada’s most shameful interprovincial deal**, proving that **Confederation does not guarantee fairness**.

Newfoundland’s ethical trajectory is **not a story of polite Canadian progress** but one of **violence, survival, and contested nationhood**. It challenges Canada to ask: *What does it mean to inherit a history of extinction? How do we reconcile with economic and political dispossession? And what obligations does a federation have to a people who joined it by the slimmest of margins?*

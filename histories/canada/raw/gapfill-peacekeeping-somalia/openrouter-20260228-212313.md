### The Canadian Peacekeeping Mythology and Its Ethical Collapse

#### 1. **The Suez Crisis (1956) and the Birth of Peacekeeping**  
The Suez Crisis marked the genesis of Canada’s peacekeeping mythology. **Lester Pearson**, then Canada’s Minister of External Affairs, proposed the creation of the **United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I)** to resolve the crisis. Pearson’s diplomatic intervention earned him the **Nobel Peace Prize in 1957**, cementing Canada’s reputation as an “honest broker” in international conflicts. The ethical framework underpinning this role emphasized **middle power diplomacy**, **multilateralism**, and the idea of Canada as a nation distinct from the militaristic United States. This narrative became central to Canadian identity—summarized in the phrase, “We are not Americans, we are peacekeepers.” However, this framing obscured Canada’s complicity in colonial violence and its alignment with Western imperial interests. Pearson himself acknowledged the limitations of peacekeeping, describing it as a “second-best” solution to war (Pearson, *Diplomacy in the Nuclear Age*, 1958).

#### 2. **The Peacekeeping Record**  
Canada’s peacekeeping legacy includes significant contributions to missions in **Cyprus (1964–)** and the **Golan Heights**, among others. At its peak, Canada deployed more peacekeepers than any other nation, reflecting its commitment to multilateralism and conflict resolution. These missions produced genuine ethical achievements, such as preventing large-scale violence and fostering stability. However, they also came at great cost: Canadian peacekeepers faced genuine risks, with casualties occurring in operations like the **1974 Cyprus conflict** and the **1993 UN mission in Croatia**. Despite these sacrifices, the peacekeeping narrative often ignored the structural limitations of UN mandates, which frequently constrained peacekeepers from intervening against active violence.

#### 3. **Romeo Dallaire and Rwanda (1994)**  
The **Rwandan Genocide** exposed the ethical failures of Canadian peacekeeping. **General Roméo Dallaire**, commander of the **United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)**, warned UN headquarters in January 1994 of an impending genocide through a now-infamous **fax**. His warnings were ignored, and over **800,000 Tutsi** were massacred while the international community stood by. Dallaire’s memoir, *Shake Hands with the Devil* (2003), remains one of the most searing ethical documents in Canadian military history, detailing the moral collapse of the UN and Canada’s role in that failure. Dallaire’s subsequent struggles with **PTSD**, suicide attempts, and advocacy for mental health care underscore the profound ethical cost of bearing witness to atrocity.

#### 4. **The Somalia Affair (1993)**  
The **Somalia Affair** shattered Canada’s peacekeeping mythology. In March 1993, members of the **Canadian Airborne Regiment** tortured and killed **Shidane Abukar Arone**, a Somali civilian. The subsequent cover-up—involving **altered documents** and **destroyed evidence**—revealed systemic ethical failures within the Canadian military. The **Somalia Inquiry**, launched in 1995, exposed institutional racism, poor leadership, and a culture of impunity. However, the inquiry was prematurely shut down by the **Chrétien government** in 1997, leaving key questions unanswered. The Airborne Regiment was disbanded in 1995, but the scandal permanently tarnished Canada’s reputation as a benevolent peacekeeper.

#### 5. **The Ethical Aftermath**  
The turn of the 21st century saw Canada shift from peacekeeping to **“peace enforcement”** and combat, most notably in **Afghanistan (2001–2014)**. The mission, which resulted in the deaths of **158 Canadian soldiers**, marked a profound ethical transformation: Canada was now a combat nation, a role it had rejected since the **Korean War (1950–1953)**. The **Highway of Heroes**, a route used to repatriate fallen soldiers, became a symbol of this new reality. The ethical crisis extended to **veteran care**, with widespread reports of inadequate mental health support for soldiers suffering from PTSD.

#### 6. **The Deschamps Report (2015)**  
The **Deschamps Report**, released in 2015, exposed systemic **sexual harassment and assault** within the Canadian Armed Forces. The report, authored by former Supreme Court Justice **Marie Deschamps**, highlighted a toxic culture that prioritized institutional reputation over the safety of its members. Allegations against **General Jonathan Vance**, the former Chief of the Defence Staff, further underscored these issues. The military’s failure to protect its own members raised profound ethical questions about an institution tasked with safeguarding the vulnerable.

#### 7. **Key Scholars and Critiques**  
Several scholars have critically examined Canada’s peacekeeping mythology:  
- **David Bercuson** has questioned the glorification of peacekeeping, arguing that it masks Canada’s militaristic tendencies (*Significant Incident*, 1996).  
- **Sherene Razack**, in *Dark Threats and White Knights* (2004), critiques the racialized and imperialist underpinnings of Canadian peacekeeping, particularly in Somalia.  
- **Sandra Whitworth** has analyzed the gendered and militarized aspects of peacekeeping (*Men, Militarism, and UN Peacekeeping*, 2004).

### Conclusion  
Canada’s peacekeeping mythology, rooted in the ethical ideals of multilateralism and conflict resolution, has undergone profound collapse. From the failures in Rwanda to the Somalia scandal and the shift to combat missions, Canada’s military and ethical identity has been irrevocably altered. The ongoing reckoning with systemic abuses within the Canadian Armed Forces highlights the urgent need for a more honest and accountable approach to Canada’s role in global conflicts.

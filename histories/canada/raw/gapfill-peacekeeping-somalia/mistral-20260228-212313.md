### **The Canadian Peacekeeping Mythology and Its Ethical Collapse**

Canada’s peacekeeping mythology emerged in the mid-20th century as a defining feature of national identity—a counterpoint to American militarism, a projection of moral exceptionalism, and a justification for middle-power diplomacy. Yet this mythology, built on selective memory and institutional self-congratulation, has repeatedly collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions: complicity in violence, systemic failures of accountability, and the betrayal of the very principles it claimed to uphold. The arc of Canadian peacekeeping is not one of steady moral progress but of ethical rupture, where the gap between myth and reality has widened into a chasm.

### **1. The Birth of the Myth: Suez, Pearson, and the Invention of Peacekeeping (1956–1957)**

The Suez Crisis of 1956 marked the birth of modern peacekeeping—and of Canada’s self-image as a nation of peacekeepers. When Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, Britain, France, and Israel invaded, threatening to ignite a wider war. The United States, fearing Soviet intervention, condemned the invasion, leaving Canada in a diplomatic bind: caught between its NATO allies and its desire to prevent escalation.

**Lester B. Pearson**, then Canada’s Secretary of State for External Affairs, proposed a novel solution: a **United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I)** to separate the warring parties and supervise a ceasefire. The plan was adopted by the UN General Assembly on **November 4, 1956 (Resolution 998)**, and UNEF I became the first armed UN peacekeeping mission. Pearson’s role earned him the **Nobel Peace Prize in 1957**, cementing Canada’s reputation as an "honest broker" in international affairs.

#### **The Ethical Framework: Middle Power Diplomacy and the "Helpful Fixer"**
Pearson’s vision was rooted in **functionalist internationalism**—the idea that middle powers like Canada could play a constructive role in global governance by offering pragmatic, multilateral solutions. In his **1957 Nobel Lecture**, Pearson framed peacekeeping as a moral imperative:
> *"The United Nations Emergency Force was not a fighting force, but a force to make fighting impossible… It was a new kind of military operation, one which required a new kind of soldier—the soldier of peace."*

This narrative took hold in Canadian public consciousness. By the 1960s, peacekeeping became a **core component of national identity**, distinguishing Canada from the United States. As political scientist **Kim Richard Nossal** argues in *The Politics of Canadian Foreign Policy* (1985), peacekeeping was not just a policy but a **myth of origin**—a way for Canadians to define themselves as morally superior to their southern neighbor.

Yet even at its inception, the myth was flawed. **UNEF I was not neutral**: it was deployed *after* the invasion, effectively freezing the status quo in favor of the aggressors. As historian **J.L. Granatstein** notes in *Canada’s Army: Waging War and Keeping the Peace* (2002), the mission was **"a Band-Aid on a gaping wound"**—a temporary fix that allowed the great powers to save face while doing little to address the underlying conflict.

### **2. The Golden Age? Canada’s Peacekeeping Record (1960s–1990s)**

At its peak in the **1990s**, Canada had more peacekeepers deployed than any other country, serving in **Cyprus (UNFICYP, 1964–1993)**, the **Golan Heights (UNDOF, 1974–present)**, and numerous other UN missions. Between **1948 and 2000**, over **125,000 Canadian military personnel** served in peacekeeping operations, with **130 Canadians killed** in the line of duty.

#### **Achievements and Risks**
- **Cyprus (1964–1993)**: Canada’s longest peacekeeping deployment, where Canadian troops maintained a buffer zone between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The mission was largely successful in preventing large-scale violence, though it did not resolve the conflict.
- **Golan Heights (1974–present)**: Canadian forces (later replaced by others) helped maintain a ceasefire between Israel and Syria, preventing direct confrontation for decades.
- **Namibia (UNTAG, 1989–1990)**: Canada played a key role in overseeing Namibia’s transition to independence, a rare success in UN peacekeeping.

Yet these missions were not without ethical ambiguities. Peacekeepers were often **under-resourced, under-mandated, and caught in impossible situations**. In **Bosnia (UNPROFOR, 1992–1995)**, Canadian troops were powerless to stop the **Srebrenica genocide (1995)**, where over **8,000 Bosniak men and boys were massacred** under the watch of Dutch peacekeepers. Canada’s own **Royal 22e Régiment** was stationed nearby but lacked the mandate to intervene—a failure that foreshadowed Rwanda.

### **3. Rwanda (1994): The Ethical Catastrophe and Romeo Dallaire’s Witness**

The **Rwandan genocide (April–July 1994)**, in which **800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were slaughtered in 100 days**, exposed the **moral bankruptcy of the peacekeeping myth**. At the center of this failure was **Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire**, the Canadian commander of the **UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR)**.

#### **The Fax That Was Ignored**
On **January 11, 1994**, three months before the genocide began, Dallaire sent a **coded cable to UN headquarters** (later known as the **"Genocide Fax"**) warning of a **Hutu extremist plan to exterminate Tutsi** and requesting authorization to raid arms caches. The UN, fearing another Somalia (where 18 U.S. soldiers had been killed in 1993), **refused**. Instead, the Security Council **reduced UNAMIR’s force from 2,500 to 270**—effectively abandoning Rwanda to its fate.

When the genocide began, Dallaire’s forces were **powerless to stop it**. In his memoir, *Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda* (2003), Dallaire writes:
> *"I know there is a God because in Rwanda I shook hands with the devil. I have seen him, I have smelled him, and I have touched him. I know the devil exists, and therefore I know there is a God."*

Dallaire’s testimony before the **International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (1998)** and his subsequent advocacy exposed the **complicity of the international community**—including Canada—in the genocide. His **PTSD, suicide attempts, and public breakdowns** became a living indictment of the peacekeeping myth: **the cost of witnessing evil and being unable to stop it**.

#### **Canada’s Role in the Failure**
- **The Canadian government, like others, ignored Dallaire’s warnings** and supported the UN’s withdrawal.
- **Foreign Minister André Ouellet** dismissed early reports of massacres as "tribal violence."
- **No Canadian troops were sent to reinforce UNAMIR**—despite Canada’s reputation as a peacekeeping leader.

The Rwanda genocide shattered the illusion that peacekeeping was inherently virtuous. As **Gerald Caplan** argues in *Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide* (2000), the international community’s failure was not just a **tactical error but a moral one**—a refusal to intervene because Rwandan lives were deemed expendable.

### **4. The Somalia Affair (1993): Canadian Soldiers as Torturers**

If Rwanda exposed the **failure of peacekeeping as a concept**, the **Somalia Affair** exposed the **rot within Canada’s own military**.

In **March 1993**, members of the **Canadian Airborne Regiment**—deployed as part of the **UNOSOM II mission in Somalia**—tortured and murdered **Shidane Abukar Arone**, a 16-year-old Somali civilian caught stealing from their compound. The soldiers **beat him to death over several hours**, taking **photographs of the abuse** as trophies. When the scandal broke, the military **covered it up**: logs were altered, evidence was destroyed, and witnesses were intimidated.

#### **The Somalia Inquiry (1995–1997) and the Collapse of Accountability**
The **Commission of Inquiry into the Deployment of Canadian Forces to Somalia (1995–1997)**, led by **Justice Gilles Létourneau**, uncovered **systemic racism, leadership failures, and a culture of impunity** in the Canadian Armed Forces. The inquiry’s interim report (1997) found:
- **"A leadership crisis"** in the military, with senior officers more concerned with **public relations than accountability**.
- **Racist attitudes** among troops, who referred to Somalis as **"Sammies"** and **"niggers."**
- **A breakdown in discipline**, with soldiers engaging in **looting, drug use, and violence** with no consequences.

Yet before the inquiry could complete its work, **Prime Minister Jean Chrétien shut it down in 1997**, citing cost and "national unity." The **Airborne Regiment was disbanded**, but **no senior officers were held accountable**. The Somalia Affair was not just a **failure of a single unit** but a **failure of the entire peacekeeping myth**: **Canadian soldiers were not neutral peacekeepers but perpetrators of violence**.

#### **Scholarly Critiques: Razack and the "New Imperialism"**
Feminist scholar **Sherene Razack**, in *Dark Threats and White Knights: The Somalia Affair, Peacekeeping, and the New Imperialism* (2004), argues that the Somalia Affair was not an aberration but a **logical outcome of Canada’s peacekeeping ideology**:
> *"Peacekeeping is not a neutral, humanitarian enterprise but a racialized project that positions white Canadians as saviors and non-white populations as threats to be managed… The torture and murder of Shidane Arone was not a breakdown in discipline but the **normal functioning of a colonial military culture**."*

Razack’s work exposes how the peacekeeping myth **erased the violence inherent in Canada’s role**—both abroad and at home.

### **5. From Peacekeeping to Combat: Afghanistan (2001–2014) and the Ethics of War**

After Somalia and Rwanda, Canada’s peacekeeping deployments **plummeted**. By the **2000s, Canada had fewer peacekeepers than Bangladesh or Ghana**. Instead, Canada embraced **combat operations**—first in **Kosovo (1999)** and then in **Afghanistan (2001–2014)**, where **158 Canadian soldiers were killed**.

#### **The Highway of Heroes and the Militarization of Memory**
The Afghanistan mission marked a **fundamental shift** in Canada’s military identity. No longer the "peacekeeping nation," Canada now presented itself as a **warrior nation**, with **public ceremonies, memorials, and the "Highway of Heroes"** (the stretch of Highway 401 where fallen soldiers’ coffins were transported).

Yet this shift was **ethically fraught**:
- **Was Afghanistan a "just war"?** The mission began as a **NATO response to 9/11** but evolved into a **counterinsurgency campaign** with questionable legality under international law.
- **Civilian casualties**: Canadian forces were implicated in **civilian deaths**, including the **2006 killing of a family in Kandahar** by a Canadian airstrike.
- **PTSD and veteran care**: The **2014 Auditor General’s report** found that **Veterans Affairs Canada was failing soldiers with PTSD**, with **suicide rates among veterans double the civilian average**.

The Afghanistan mission forced Canada to confront a **painful truth**: **the peacekeeping myth had always been a lie**. Canada was not just a nation of blue helmets but a **combat nation**, with all the moral ambiguities that entailed.

### **6. The Deschamps Report (2015): Sexual Violence and Institutional Rot**

The final collapse of the peacekeeping myth came not from external failures but from **internal betrayal**. In **2015, former Supreme Court Justice Marie Deschamps** released her **External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces**, which found:
- **A "sexualized culture"** in the military, where **harassment and assault were widespread**.
- **A "hostile environment"** for women and LGBTQ+ members.
- **A failure of leadership**, with senior officers **ignoring or covering up abuse**.

The report was followed by **scandals involving high-ranking officers**, including **General Jonathan Vance**, who was accused of **sexual misconduct** in 2021. The Deschamps Report exposed the **hypocrisy of an institution that claimed to protect the vulnerable while failing to protect its own members**.

### **7. The Aftermath: Can the Myth Be Rebuilt?**

Today, Canada’s peacekeeping mythology lies in **ruins**. The **2017 Defence Policy Review** acknowledged that Canada had **fewer than 50 peacekeepers deployed**—a far cry from its golden age. Yet the myth persists in **political rhetoric**, with Prime Minister **Justin Trudeau** pledging in **2016** to **re-engage in peacekeeping** (a promise that has gone largely unfulfilled).

#### **Key Scholars and the Debate Over the Myth’s Legacy**
- **David Bercuson** (*Significant Incident: Canada’s Army, the Airborne, and the Murder in Somalia*, 1996) argues that the Somalia Affair was a **failure of leadership**, not a systemic flaw in peacekeeping.
- **Sherene Razack** (*Dark Threats and White Knights*, 2004) counters that the myth itself was **racist and colonial**, masking Canada’s role in global violence.
- **Sandra Whitworth** (*Men, Militarism, and UN Peacekeeping*, 2004) examines how **gender and militarism intersect** in peacekeeping, showing how the myth **erased the experiences of women soldiers and civilian victims**.

#### **The Ethical Question: What Comes Next?**
The collapse of the peacekeeping myth leaves Canada with an **uncomfortable truth**: **there is no moral high ground, only the messy, violent reality of power**. The challenge now is not to **resurrect the myth** but to **confront its failures**—to ask:
- **How can Canada engage in peacekeeping (or combat) without reproducing colonial violence?**
- **How can the military be held accountable for its own abuses?**
- **How can Canada’s foreign policy reflect its stated values, rather than its historical hypocrisies?**

The peacekeeping myth was never just about **what Canada did abroad**—it was about **who Canadians thought they were**. Its collapse forces a reckoning with a harder question: **Who are we, really?**

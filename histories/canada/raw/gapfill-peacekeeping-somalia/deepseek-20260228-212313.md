## The Peacekeeping Mythos and Its Ethical Unravelling

### 1. The Birth of a Mythology: Suez and the "Honest Broker"
The foundational moment for Canadian peacekeeping identity was the **Suez Crisis of 1956**. As Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt, Canadian External Affairs Minister **Lester B. Pearson** proposed the creation of the **United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I)**—a neutral, armed interposition force to supervise the cessation of hostilities. Pearson’s plan, articulated in the UN General Assembly on November 2, 1956, framed the mission as a "truly international peace and police force" (UN Doc A/3276). For this, Pearson was awarded the **Nobel Peace Prize in 1957**.

The ethical framework was explicitly that of a **"middle power"**: a nation leveraging multilateral institutions, acting as an "honest broker" between great powers and within conflict zones. This identity was constructed in direct contrast to American unilateralism and British/French colonialism. As historian **J.L. Granatstein** notes, this became a core national narrative: "Canadians were the world's peacekeepers, the helpful fixers, the good people" (*Canada's Army: Waging War and Keeping the Peace*, 2002). The mythology served a dual purpose: it provided a distinct post-colonial identity and masked the less noble aspects of Canadian foreign policy, including economic self-interest and alignment with Western bloc objectives.

### 2. The Operational Record: Achievements and Contradictions
Canada’s peacekeeping commitment was substantial. From **Cyprus (UNFICYP, 1964 onward)** to the **Golan Heights (UNDOF, 1974 onward)**, Canadian soldiers and officers served in dozens of UN missions. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Canada often led the world in raw numbers of deployed peacekeepers. The ethical achievements were real: facilitating ceasefires, protecting civilians in buffer zones, and providing a model of disciplined, neutral intervention. **119 Canadian peacekeepers died** on such missions between 1947 and 2021 (National Defence records), a testament to the genuine risks undertaken.

However, the record was never purely altruistic. Peacekeeping served Canadian diplomatic interests, providing influence disproportionate to its military or economic weight. Furthermore, as scholar **Sandra Whitworth** argues in *Men, Militarism, and UN Peacekeeping* (2004), the practice often functioned to "freeze" conflicts in ways that served Western geopolitical interests, rather than resolve underlying injustices. The ethical framework of neutrality was repeatedly strained when peacekeepers were deployed to monitor, but not challenge, deeply unjust status quos.

### 3. The Catastrophic Failure: Rwanda and Romeo Dallaire
The ethical collapse of peacekeeping’s core promise—to protect the vulnerable—was most horrifically demonstrated in Rwanda in 1994. Canadian Major-General **Roméo Dallaire** commanded the **United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)**. On **January 11, 1994**, Dallaire sent a now-infamous "genocide fax" to UN Headquarters (UN Doc S/1994/58/Add.1), warning of Hutu extremist plans to exterminate Tutsis and requesting authorization to raid arms caches. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations, led by Kofi Annan, ordered him not to proceed, reflecting a policy of strict neutrality and risk-aversion.

When the genocide began in April, Dallaire’s under-equipped and under-mandated force was powerless to stop the slaughter of over 800,000 people. His memoir, ***Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda* (2003)**, stands as the most searing Canadian ethical document on the subject. It details not only the international failure but the profound personal moral injury. Dallaire’s subsequent struggle with PTSD, documented suicide attempts, and advocacy for veterans and genocide prevention embody the devastating ethical cost of bearing witness to a preventable catastrophe that the "peacekeeping" system failed to halt.

### 4. The Myth Shattered: The Somalia Affair
If Rwanda represented a failure of the international system, the **Somalia Affair (1993)** shattered the myth of inherent Canadian virtue. During the UN-sanctioned, US-led mission (UNOSOM II), members of the **Canadian Airborne Regiment** tortured and murdered **16-year-old Shidane Abukar Arone** on **March 16, 1993**. Photographs of the torture surfaced, revealing profound brutality. A subsequent military police investigation uncovered a culture of racism, violence, and indiscipline.

The **Somalia Inquiry**, a royal commission launched in 1995, exposed a systemic cover-up: altered documents, destroyed evidence, and obstruction by senior military officials. However, before it could complete its work or assign responsibility at the highest levels, the **Chrétien government shut it down in 1997** (Order in Council P.C. 1997-1009). The Airborne Regiment was disbanded in **1995**. As scholar **Sherene Razack** argues in ***Dark Threats and White Knights: The Somalia Affair, Peacekeeping, and the New Imperialism* (2004)**, the affair revealed how peacekeeping could function as a "civilizing" narrative that obscured the racism and violence of the peacekeepers themselves. The "white knights" were exposed as torturers.

### 5. The Ethical Pivot: From Peacekeeping to Combat
The dual traumas of Rwanda and Somalia catalyzed a shift in Canadian military policy away from traditional UN peacekeeping. The **War in Afghanistan (2001-2014)** marked a definitive turn toward **"peace enforcement"** and high-intensity combat within a NATO framework—a role Canada had largely avoided since the Korean War. **158 Canadian soldiers** were killed, their repatriations marked by the public ritual of the **"Highway of Heroes."**

This shift provoked an ongoing ethical crisis about national identity. Were Canadians still peacekeepers, or were they combatants? The war also precipitated a domestic ethical failure: the inadequate care for veterans suffering from physical injuries and PTSD. The **New Veterans Charter (2006)** was widely criticized for replacing lifelong pensions with lump-sum payments, leading to the **Equitas Society lawsuit** and ongoing advocacy for improved care, highlighting the state’s ethical obligation to those it sends to fight.

### 6. Institutional Rot: The Deschamps Report and #MeToo in the CAF
The ethical reckoning within the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) reached a new peak with the **2015 Report by former Justice Marie Deschamps**. Commissioned by the Chief of the Defence Staff, the **External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces** found a "hostile sexualized environment," particularly for women, and an institutional culture "conducive to more serious incidents of sexual harassment and assault." It described a "broken" complaint system and a fear of reprisal.

This systemic failure of care and accountability within the institution tasked with protecting others was starkly exemplified by allegations against the very top: **General Jonathan Vance**, the Chief of the Defence Staff (2015-2021), faced allegations of inappropriate conduct (first reported by Global News in February 2021), leading to a crisis of leadership. The ongoing **"Op HONOUR"** and subsequent initiatives have struggled to change the culture, demonstrating that the ethical framework of the military—its duty to protect—remains profoundly compromised from within.

### 7. Scholarly Reckoning
Key scholars have deconstructed the peacekeeping mythology:
*   **David Bercuson** (*Significant Incident: Canada's Army, the Airborne, and the Murder in Somalia*, 1996) provided a detailed, damning account of the institutional failures.
*   **Sherene Razack** (2004) applied a critical race and postcolonial lens, showing how peacekeeping narratives reinforced imperial hierarchies and white supremacy.
*   **Sandra Whitworth** (2004) used feminist international relations theory to reveal the gendered and militarized contradictions at the heart of peacekeeping practice.

**Conclusion:** The Canadian peacekeeping myth was born from a genuine diplomatic innovation at Suez, nurtured through decades of service, and ultimately fractured by a series of ethical collapses: the failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda, the commission of torture in Somalia, the pivot to a bloody combat role in Afghanistan, and the exposure of a toxic, predatory institutional culture at home. The narrative of Canada as the "honest broker" and benevolent peacekeeper served to obscure a more complex reality of complicity, violence, and institutional failing, forcing an ongoing—and still unresolved—ethical reckoning with the nation's role in the world and the character of its institutions.

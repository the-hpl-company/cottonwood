Okay, here is an analysis of the Canadian peacekeeping mythology and its ethical collapse, addressing the points you've outlined and adhering to your specific instructions.

### The Genesis of a Myth: Peacekeeping as National Identity

The idea of Canada as a "peacekeeper" is deeply embedded in the national narrative, particularly in contrast to the United States. This image took root during the Suez Crisis of 1956. When Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, Britain, France, and Israel launched a military intervention. Then-Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson proposed the creation of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) to separate the warring parties. Pearson's plan allowed Britain, France, and Israel to withdraw while avoiding a potential escalation with the Soviet Union. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for his efforts. This cemented peacekeeping as central to Canadian identity.

This identity rested on a perceived ethical framework: Canada as a middle power, acting as an honest broker through multilateralism. This was reflected in government statements and public discourse. The idea was that Canada, unburdened by imperial ambitions and great power rivalries, could act as a neutral and trusted mediator in international conflicts.

### The Peacekeeping Record: Achievements and Risks

Canada actively participated in numerous peacekeeping missions, most notably in Cyprus (UNFICYP, 1964-) and on the Golan Heights (UNDOF). At its peak, Canada was among the largest contributors of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations. These missions involved genuine achievements, such as preventing further escalation of conflicts and providing humanitarian assistance. However, peacekeeping was never without risks. Canadian peacekeepers faced dangerous situations and sustained casualties. While the official narrative emphasized the peaceful nature of these missions, peacekeepers often operated in environments characterized by violence and instability.

### Rwanda: The Ethical Abyss

The Rwandan genocide of 1994 exposed the limitations and ethical failures of the peacekeeping framework. Canadian General Romeo Dallaire commanded the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). He witnessed the systematic slaughter of approximately 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. Dallaire's repeated requests for reinforcements and a stronger mandate were denied by the UN Security Council. His famous fax to UN headquarters, warning of the impending genocide, was ignored. This exposed the hypocrisy of the international community and the inadequacy of the peacekeeping mandate in the face of mass atrocities.

Dallaire's personal experience and his subsequent book, *Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda* (2003), became a landmark Canadian ethical document. It detailed the horrors he witnessed, the bureaucratic obstacles he faced, and his own descent into post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dallaire's story demonstrated the immense ethical cost borne by peacekeepers who are forced to stand by while atrocities occur. His subsequent advocacy for the prevention of genocide and the improvement of mental health support for veterans highlights the long-term consequences of ethical failure in peacekeeping.

### Somalia: The Shattered Image

While Rwanda exposed the failures of the international community, the Somalia Affair (1993) shattered the Canadian peacekeeping myth from within. Members of the Canadian Airborne Regiment, deployed to Somalia as part of a UN mission, tortured and killed Shidane Abukar Arone, a Somali teenager. The subsequent investigation revealed a culture of racism and brutality within the regiment, as well as attempts to cover up the crime through altered documents and destroyed evidence. The Somalia Inquiry (1997) was shut down by the Chrétien government before it could fully investigate the chain of command, raising questions about political interference and accountability. The Airborne Regiment was disbanded in 1995. The Somalia Affair forced Canadians to confront the uncomfortable truth that their soldiers were capable of acts of extreme violence. This challenged the idealized image of the Canadian peacekeeper as a benevolent and impartial actor.

Sherene Razack's *Dark Threats and White Knights: The Somalia Affair, Peacekeeping, and the New Imperialism* (2004) provides a critical analysis of the Somalia Affair, arguing that it exposed the racist and colonial underpinnings of Canadian peacekeeping. She contends that the incident revealed the ways in which Canadian peacekeeping was often used to legitimize Western intervention in the Global South.

### From Peacekeeping to Peace Enforcement: Afghanistan and Beyond

The ethical crisis triggered by Rwanda and Somalia led to a shift in Canadian foreign policy away from traditional peacekeeping and towards "peace enforcement" and combat roles. Canada's participation in the war in Afghanistan (2001-2014) marked a significant departure from its traditional peacekeeping role. 158 Canadian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan, and many more were wounded. The "Highway of Heroes," where the bodies of fallen soldiers were repatriated, became a symbol of the sacrifices made in the name of this new mission.

This shift raised fundamental ethical questions about Canada's role in the world. Was Canada abandoning its commitment to multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution in favor of a more aggressive and interventionist foreign policy? The high cost in human lives and the questionable outcomes of the war in Afghanistan led to a re-evaluation of Canada's ethical responsibilities in a post-9/11 world. The rise in PTSD cases among returning veterans, and the challenges in providing adequate mental health support, further underscored the ethical costs of Canada's involvement in combat operations.

### The Deschamps Report: A Crisis of Institutional Ethics

The Deschamps Report (2015) exposed a systemic problem of sexual harassment and assault within the Canadian Armed Forces. The report found that the military culture was conducive to sexual misconduct and that victims were often afraid to come forward due to fear of retaliation. Allegations of misconduct against senior military leaders, including General Jonathan Vance, further eroded public trust in the institution.

The Deschamps Report raised profound ethical questions about the military's ability to protect its own members, particularly women. It highlighted the hypocrisy of an institution that claims to protect the vulnerable while failing to address systemic abuse within its ranks. The ongoing reckoning with sexual misconduct in the military is a stark reminder that ethical failures can occur even in institutions that are ostensibly dedicated to upholding moral values.

### Conclusion

The Canadian peacekeeping mythology has been significantly challenged by a series of ethical failures and evolving geopolitical realities. The Rwandan genocide, the Somalia Affair, the war in Afghanistan, and the sexual misconduct crisis in the military have all exposed the limitations and contradictions of the peacekeeping narrative. While Canada can still take pride in its contributions to international peace and security, it must also confront its past failures and work to build a more ethical and accountable foreign policy.

Here is an exploration of the ethical traditions of prairie settler communities in Canada, focusing on those who sought religious and ethical freedom.

### Doukhobors

The Doukhobors, meaning "Spirit Wrestlers," arrived in Canada in 1899, fleeing persecution in Russia due to their pacifist beliefs and rejection of both church and state. Financed in part by Leo Tolstoy, about 7,500 Doukhobors settled in Saskatchewan. Their ethical framework centered on communal living, pacifism, vegetarianism, and the rejection of secular authority, rooted in a belief that God resides within each individual. This translated into a radical social vision where private property was abolished and collective labor was embraced.

The community faced internal and external pressures. The leadership of Peter "Lordly" Verigin, who exercised considerable control, caused divisions between the Community Doukhobors (who adhered to communal living) and the Independent Doukhobors (who favored greater autonomy).

A more radical faction, the Sons of Freedom, emerged in the early 20th century, employing controversial methods to express their dissent. Nude protest marches and arson were used as forms of spiritual purification and resistance against assimilation. These actions, while seen by some as ethical statements against materialism and government interference, were widely condemned as acts of terrorism. George Woodcock, in "The Doukhobors" (1968), grapples with the complexities of their motivations, portraying them as driven by a fervent desire to maintain their spiritual purity in the face of perceived corruption.

The Sons of Freedom's actions led to severe repercussions, including the mass removal of Doukhobor children by the British Columbia government in the 1950s. Approximately 340 children were forcibly taken from their families and placed in foster care, an action justified by the government as necessary to protect the children from the "immoral" environment created by their parents. This traumatic episode, echoing earlier injustices faced by Indigenous communities, remains a deeply contentious chapter in Canadian history, highlighting the clash between state authority and religious freedom and the ongoing legacy of child removal.

### Mennonites

Mennonites migrated to Canada from Russia and Ukraine in two major waves, first in the 1870s and again in the 1920s, seeking to preserve their religious beliefs and cultural practices. Their ethical framework revolved around pacifism, simple living, mutual aid, and *Gelassenheit* (yieldedness), a concept emphasizing humility and submission to God's will.

The Canadian government offered Mennonites the "Privilegium" in 1873, guaranteeing religious freedom, exemption from military service, and the right to maintain their own schools. In return, the Mennonites agreed to settle in closed communities in the prairies, a system known as the "reserve system." These reserves provided a degree of internal governance, allowing Mennonites to maintain their distinct way of life.

The Mennonite commitment to pacifism was severely tested during both World War I and World War II. The *War Measures Act* (1914) suspended civil liberties during WWI, causing great anxiety for Mennonites as war fever swept the nation. While initially exempt from military service, this exemption was later challenged, leading to alternative service options such as forestry and road work. During WWII, conscientious objectors were again permitted alternative service. Royden Loewen, in "*Family, Church, and Market: A Mennonite Community in the Old and the New Worlds, 1850-1930*" (1993) examines the struggle of Mennonites to maintain their pacifist stance in the face of societal pressure and wartime fervor.

Mennonites navigated a complex tension between separation from the world and engagement with Canadian society. While striving to maintain their distinct identity, they also contributed to the economic and social fabric of the prairies. This tension continues to shape Mennonite identity in Canada today.

### Hutterites

Like the Mennonites, Hutterites are Anabaptists who practice communal living. They arrived in Canada from the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seeking refuge from persecution for their pacifist beliefs. All property is held in common within Hutterite colonies, reflecting a commitment to economic equality and mutual support.

The *Communal Property Act* in Alberta (1947) placed restrictions on Hutterite land acquisition, reflecting anxieties about their growing economic influence and perceived social conservatism. The Act limited the size and proximity of Hutterite colonies. While Hutterites are economically successful, their social conservatism, including traditional gender roles and limited interaction with the outside world, has generated controversy.

The Hutterite experience presents an ethical paradox: they are simultaneously the most successful communist experiment in North America, demonstrating the viability of communal living, and a deeply socially conservative society. This tension raises questions about the relationship between economic equality, social progress, and individual freedom.

### Ukrainian Settlers

Ukrainian settlers began arriving in Canada in the late 19th century, establishing bloc settlements in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Recruited as agricultural laborers, they were promised land and religious freedom. Frances Swyripa's "*Storied Landscapes: Ethno-Religious Identity and the Canadian Prairies*" (2010) explores the ways in which Ukrainian settlers shaped and were shaped by the prairie environment.

During World War I, Ukrainian Canadians faced severe discrimination and persecution. Despite being Austrian subjects fleeing the same empire Canada was fighting, 8,579 were interned as "enemy aliens" under the *War Measures Act* (1914). Their property was confiscated, and they were forced to perform labor. This episode represents a dark chapter in Canadian history, exposing the hypocrisy of a nation claiming to uphold freedom while simultaneously violating the rights of its own residents. The *Ukrainian Canadian Redress Agreement* (2005) offered a symbolic apology and compensation for the injustices suffered during the internment.

### The Cooperative Movement

The cooperative movement emerged as a powerful force on the Canadian prairies in the early 20th century, driven by a desire for economic democracy and social justice. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (1924), credit unions, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) were key institutions in this movement.

The CCF, founded in 1932, advocated for socialist policies aimed at addressing economic inequality and social injustice. Tommy Douglas, as Premier of Saskatchewan, spearheaded the implementation of medicare in 1962, a groundbreaking initiative that provided universal healthcare to all residents. This was a pivotal moment in Canadian social policy.

The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (1961) faced fierce opposition from doctors, who went on strike in protest. Despite this resistance, medicare proved to be a resounding success and was eventually adopted across Canada. The cooperative movement's ethical framework emphasized mutual aid as a democratic practice, rejecting the notion of charity as a substitute for systemic change. Ian MacPherson's "*Building and Protecting the Co-operative Movement: A Vision for the Twenty-First Century*" (1995) examines the history and enduring relevance of the cooperative movement in Canada.

### The Ethics of Settlement

The *Dominion Lands Act* (1872) played a central role in the settlement of the Canadian prairies, offering free land to settlers who met certain conditions. The homestead system attracted immigrants from around the world, transforming the prairies into a mosaic of cultures and communities.

However, the settlement process was deeply entangled with the dispossession of Indigenous peoples. The land granted to settlers had been taken from Indigenous nations through the numbered treaties, agreements that were often negotiated under duress and whose terms were frequently violated.

Settlers were often aware of the injustice inherent in the settlement process. Some expressed sympathy for the plight of Indigenous peoples, while others justified their presence on the land through a belief in their own superiority or a sense of entitlement. The ethical tension between seeking a better life for themselves and contributing to the displacement of Indigenous peoples remains a complex and troubling aspect of prairie history. How individual settlers and communities grappled with this tension is a question that demands further investigation.

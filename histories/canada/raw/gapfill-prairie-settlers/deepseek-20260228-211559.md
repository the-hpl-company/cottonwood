### Ethical Traditions of Prairie Settler Communities: Freedom, Communalism, and Contradiction

The Canadian prairies were not merely an empty geography to be filled, but a contested moral landscape where diverse communities—fleeing persecution in Europe—sought to enact radical ethical visions. Their settlements were experiments in pacifism, communalism, and cooperative democracy, but these experiments were built upon the foundational and often unresolved violence of Indigenous displacement. This history is one of profound ethical aspiration entangled with complicity and state repression.

#### 1. The Doukhobors: Radical Pacifism and State Violence
The Doukhobors ("Spirit-Wrestlers") were a Russian sect that rejected Orthodox Church authority, military service, and private property. With financial aid from Leo Tolstoy using royalties from his novel *Resurrection*, approximately 7,500 Doukhobors emigrated to Saskatchewan in 1899. Their ethical framework was encapsulated in their motto, **"Toil and Peaceful Life,"** and their practice of *sobranie* (communal assembly).

Under leader **Peter Vasilyevich Verigin** (who arrived in 1902), they established communal villages (*derevni*) holding land in common under the **Community Doukhobor** organization. A 1905 federal order-in-council requiring an oath of allegiance to the Crown (and thus potential military service) triggered a crisis. Verigin led a migration to British Columbia, where they purchased land collectively. A major split emerged between the **Community Doukhobors** (following Verigin) and the **Independent Doukhobors**, who accepted individual land ownership.

The most radical faction, the **Sons of Freedom**, emerged in the 1920s. Interpreting Doukhobor teachings literally, they engaged in nude protests (symbolizing spiritual purity and rejection of material society) and arson against their own and government property, including schools they saw as tools of assimilation. The state response was severe: the **BC government, under the *Protection of Children Act*, authorized the mass removal of Doukhobor children from their families between 1953 and 1959**, placing them in a former sanatorium in New Denver. This constituted a second major child-removal scandal in Canadian history, parallel to Indigenous residential schools. As historian **George Woodcock** noted in *The Doukhobors* (1968), the conflict was a tragic collision between an "archaic form of Christian anarchism" and a modern state incapable of tolerating it.

#### 2. Mennonites: *Gelassenheit* and the Bargain of Separation
Mennonites arrived in two major waves: from Russian Ukraine in the 1870s, and again as refugees from Soviet persecution in the 1920s. Their ethical core was *Gelassenheit* (yieldedness to God and community), expressed through pacifism, simple living (*Einfall*), and mutual aid. The Canadian government, eager to settle the prairies, granted them a crucial privilege via the **1873 Order-in-Council**: exemption from military service and the right to German-language private schools.

This established a **"reserve system"** of bloc settlements—notably the **East Reserve (Manitoba)** and **West Reserve (Manitoba/Saskatchewan)**—with internal religious governance. Their pacifism was tested in both World Wars. In WWI, despite their exemption, public hostility was intense; some Mennonites performed **alternative service** in forestry and road work. In WWII, the government formalized alternative service camps. The tension between separation and engagement accelerated after 1945, leading to a spectrum from traditional *Altkolonier* communities to urban, assimilated Mennonites. Scholar **Royden Loewen**, in *Diaspora in the Countryside* (2006), traces how this tension played out in the daily struggle to maintain a "gemeinschaft" in a "gesellschaft" world.

#### 3. Hutterites: Successful Communism and Legal Containment
Hutterites are Anabaptists who practice the most rigorous communalism, holding **all property in common** (*Gütergemeinschaft*) in self-sufficient agricultural colonies (*Bruderhöfe*). Their success as what some call "the most successful communist experiment in North America" provoked backlash. In 1947, the Alberta government passed the **Communal Property Act**, restricting the establishment of new colonies to areas 40 miles from an existing colony and requiring government approval for land purchases. This was a clear attempt to contain their economic and demographic expansion, justified by nativist fears. The Act was repealed in 1972 after being found ultra vires, but it exemplifies the state's discomfort with a thriving, closed communal society within a capitalist framework. Their ethics are a paradox: radically egalitarian and pacifist internally, yet patriarchal and resistant to external social change.

#### 4. Ukrainian Settlers: Bloc Settlements and Wartime Betrayal
Ukrainian peasants, largely from Austro-Hungarian Galicia and Bukovyna, established bloc settlements across the prairie provinces from the 1890s onward, such as the **Edna-Star colony in Alberta** (the largest). Their ethical world was rooted in village cooperation (*toloka*) and Eastern Christian traditions. This did not protect them when Canada entered WWI. Under the 1914 **War Measures Act**, approximately **8,579 individuals of Ukrainian and other "enemy alien" origins were interned in camps**, including at Banff and Jasper, where they performed forced labour. They were subjects of an empire Austria-Hungary, which many had fled, yet were deemed disloyal. This state-sanctioned injustice lingered in community memory until the **Ukrainian Canadian Redress Agreement (2005)**, which provided symbolic compensation and acknowledged the injustice. Historian **Frances Swyripa**, in *Wedded to the Cause* (1993), details how this experience shaped a dual Ukrainian-Canadian identity, forged in resilience against prejudice.

#### 5. The Cooperative Movement: Mutual Aid as Democratic Praxis
The cooperative movement emerged as a pragmatic ethical response to capitalist exploitation on the prairies. The **Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association** and the 1924 formation of the **Saskatchewan Wheat Pool** (a farmer-owned cooperative) institutionalized mutual aid as business. This ethos fed directly into politics via the **Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)**, founded in 1932 in Calgary. Its 1933 **Regina Manifesto** famously vowed to eradicate capitalism. The apex of this tradition was **Saskatchewan's Medicare Act (1962)**, pioneered by CCF Premier **Tommy Douglas**. It established the ethical principle of healthcare as a right, funded by public taxation. The **23-day doctors' strike of 1962** against the plan highlighted the fierce opposition from established interests. As **Ian MacPherson** argues in *Building and Protecting the Co-operative Movement* (2014), the movement's ethic was "community development and democratic practice," distinct from both charity and corporate profit.

#### 6. The Foundational Ethical Tension: Settlement on Dispossessed Land
All these communities benefited from the **Dominion Lands Act (1872)**, which offered 160-acre homesteads for a $10 fee. This "free land" was made available only after the Crown had extinguished Indigenous title through the **Numbered Treaties (1871-1921)**. The ethical tension is inescapable: communities fleeing persecution in Europe became beneficiaries of a colonial project that displaced Indigenous nations. Some were acutely aware. **Mennonite leaders**, for example, negotiated their privileges directly with the Crown, seeing a parallel to their experience in Russia—but this cast Indigenous peoples as the previous occupants to be displaced, not as treaty partners. Doukhobors, despite their own persecution, settled on Treaty 4 and Treaty 6 lands. The cooperative movement's vision of a just society rarely included a reckoning with its foundation on Indigenous territory. This remains the unresolved shadow in the prairie ethical narrative.

#### Conclusion
The prairie settler ethical traditions represent a complex mosaic of radical non-conformism, communal solidarity, and democratic innovation, persistently tested by state power and social hostility. Their stories are not of a "polite Canada" but of fierce struggles to define freedom and community. Yet, these struggles for ethical life were, from the outset, compromised by their participation in the settler-colonial project. A full accounting requires honoring their aspirations while confronting their complicity in the displacement of Indigenous peoples—a foundational tension that continues to shape the moral landscape of the Canadian prairies.

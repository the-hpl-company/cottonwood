### **Ethical Traditions of Prairie Settler Communities: Freedom, Faith, and the Land’s Unsettled Ethics**

The Canadian Prairies became a crucible for communities fleeing persecution, seeking religious and ethical autonomy, and attempting to build alternative social orders. These settlers—Doukhobors, Mennonites, Hutterites, Ukrainians, and cooperative socialists—brought with them radical visions of pacifism, communalism, mutual aid, and resistance to state authority. Yet their ethical frameworks were tested by the realities of settlement on Indigenous lands, state repression, and internal fractures. Their stories reveal both the possibilities and contradictions of ethical dissent in a settler-colonial society.

### **1. The Doukhobors: Pacifism, Communalism, and the Crisis of the State**
**Ethical Framework:**
The Doukhobors ("Spirit Wrestlers") emerged in 18th-century Russia as a radical Christian sect rejecting the Orthodox Church, state authority, private property, and violence. Their theology was embodied in the *Living Book*—oral psalms and hymns passed down through generations. Leo Tolstoy, who saw them as living embodiments of his own Christian anarchism, helped fund their emigration to Canada in 1899, writing in *The Kingdom of God Is Within You* (1894) that their refusal to participate in war made them "the most consistent and logical Christians."

**Settlement and Schism:**
Under the leadership of Peter "Lordly" Verigin, 7,500 Doukhobors arrived in Saskatchewan in 1899, establishing communal villages (*mir*) where land and labor were shared. The Canadian government, eager for agricultural settlers, granted them exemptions from military service (Order-in-Council PC 2747, 1898) and allowed communal landholding—though this was later revoked in 1907 when the *Dominion Lands Act* (1872) was amended to require individual homesteading.

The community fractured:
- **The Community Doukhobors** (later the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ, USCC) maintained communal living under Verigin’s leadership.
- **The Independent Doukhobors** abandoned communalism, assimilating into Canadian society.
- **The Sons of Freedom** (Svobodniki) radicalized, seeing Verigin’s compromises with the state as betrayal. They engaged in nude protests (symbolizing purity and rejection of materialism) and arson (targeting property, not people) as acts of "ethical witness." The Canadian state responded with repression: the *Criminal Code* was amended in 1908 to criminalize public nudity, and in the 1950s, the BC government forcibly removed **174 Doukhobor children** (ages 7–15) from their families, placing them in a residential school-like facility in New Denver (1953–1959). This was justified under the *Child Welfare Act* (BC, 1948), which allowed the state to intervene in cases of "neglect"—defined broadly enough to include cultural and religious practices deemed "un-Canadian."

**Legacy:**
The Doukhobors’ story is one of ethical consistency met with state violence. As George Woodcock argues in *The Doukhobors* (1977), their radical pacifism and communalism were "a living reproach to the acquisitive individualism of North American society." Yet their internal divisions—between accommodation and resistance—mirror the broader tension in settler ethics: how to maintain dissent in a society built on the very structures they rejected.

### **2. Mennonites: Gelassenheit, Pacifism, and the Tension of Separation**
**Ethical Framework:**
Mennonites, descendants of the 16th-century Anabaptist movement, arrived in Canada in two major waves: the **1870s** (from Russia, fleeing conscription) and the **1920s** (escaping Soviet persecution). Their ethics were rooted in *Gelassenheit*—a yieldedness to God and community over individual ambition—and the *Schleitheim Confession* (1527), which mandated pacifism, adult baptism, and separation from "the world."

**The Reserve System and Conscientious Objection:**
The Canadian government, eager for agricultural settlers, granted Mennonites **privileges** in the *Dominion Lands Act* (1872), including exemption from military service and the right to establish **reserves** (e.g., the **East Reserve** and **West Reserve** in Manitoba) with internal governance. This was formalized in the **Privilegium** (1873), a contract between the Canadian government and Mennonite delegates.

The **World Wars** tested their pacifism:
- **WWI (1914–1918):** Mennonites were exempted from combat but faced hostility. The *Military Service Act* (1917) initially allowed for alternative service, but enforcement was inconsistent. Some Mennonites were jailed for refusing even non-combatant roles.
- **WWII (1939–1945):** The *National War Services Regulations* (1940) established **Alternative Service Work Camps**, where Mennonite conscientious objectors (COs) worked in forestry, hospitals, and road construction. Over **10,000 Mennonite men** served in these camps, though some, like **Jacob H. Janzen**, resisted even this compromise, arguing that any cooperation with the war machine violated their faith.

**Engagement vs. Separation:**
The Mennonite experience reveals a fundamental tension: how to live out *Gelassenheit* in a society that demands participation. As historian **Royden Loewen** (*Village Among Nations*, 1992) notes, Mennonite colonies were "islands of difference" in a sea of Canadian individualism. Yet by the mid-20th century, many Mennonites—particularly in urban centers—began engaging with broader society, leading to debates over assimilation. The **Mennonite Central Committee (MCC, 1920)** became a key institution for relief work, embodying a shift from strict separation to active, if still critical, engagement.

### **3. Hutterites: Communalism and the Limits of Tolerance**
**Ethical Framework:**
The Hutterites, like the Mennonites, were Anabaptists, but they took communal living to its logical extreme: all property was held in common, and colonies (*Bruderhöfe*) operated as self-sufficient economic units. Their ethics were rooted in the *Schleitheim Confession* and the writings of **Jakob Hutter** (d. 1536), who argued that true Christian community required the abolition of private property.

**Settlement and State Repression:**
Hutterites arrived in Canada in the **1870s** (from Russia) and again in the **1930s** (fleeing Nazi Germany). They established colonies in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, where they became highly successful farmers—so successful that they provoked backlash. In 1942, Alberta passed the **Communal Property Act**, which:
- Prohibited Hutterites from purchasing land within **40 miles** of existing colonies.
- Required government approval for any new colony.
- Justified these measures as necessary to prevent "monopolization" of land.

The Act was a clear violation of religious freedom, yet it remained in place until **1973**, when it was struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Hofer v. Hofer* (1970). The Court ruled that the Act infringed on the Hutterites’ freedom of religion under the *Canadian Bill of Rights* (1960), but the damage was done: Hutterite expansion had been severely restricted for decades.

**The Paradox of Hutterite Ethics:**
The Hutterites represent the most successful **communist experiment** in North America—colonies operate without private property, wages, or individual accumulation. Yet their social conservatism (e.g., gender roles, resistance to public education) complicates their radical economic ethics. As historian **Rod Janzen** (*The Prairie People*, 1999) argues, Hutterites embody a "communalism of necessity"—their economic model works because it is sustained by strict social control.

### **4. Ukrainian Settlers: Bloc Settlements and the Violence of "Enemy Alien" Designation**
**Ethical Framework:**
Ukrainian settlers, arriving in the **1890s–1910s**, were not a religious sect but a national community fleeing Austro-Hungarian oppression. They established **bloc settlements** (e.g., **Edna-Star** in Alberta, **Dauphin** in Manitoba) where they preserved language, Orthodox and Greek Catholic traditions, and cooperative farming practices.

**Internment and Redress:**
Despite fleeing the same empire Canada was fighting in **WWI**, Ukrainians were labeled **"enemy aliens"** under the *War Measures Act* (1914). Between **1914–1920**, **8,579 Ukrainian Canadians** (along with Germans, Austrians, and other Eastern Europeans) were interned in **24 camps** across Canada, including **Banff, Jasper, and Spirit Lake (Quebec)**. They were forced into labor, building roads and clearing land, with their property confiscated.

The **Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association (UCCLA)** campaigned for decades for recognition. In **2005**, the Canadian government signed the **Ukrainian Canadian Redress Agreement**, providing **$10 million** for commemorative projects and education—but no individual compensation. As historian **Lubomyr Luciuk** (*In Fear of the Barbed Wire Fence*, 2001) argues, the internment was not just a wartime measure but a **racialized policy**, targeting Eastern Europeans as "undesirable" settlers.

**Ethical Reckoning:**
Ukrainian Canadians’ experience reveals the fragility of settler belonging. Despite their contributions to Prairie agriculture and culture, they were disposable when the state deemed them a threat. Their story complicates the narrative of Canada as a refuge: for many, it was a place of conditional acceptance.

### **5. The Cooperative Movement: Mutual Aid as Democratic Practice**
**Ethical Framework:**
The Prairies became a laboratory for **cooperative economics**, rooted in the belief that mutual aid—not charity or state welfare—was the ethical foundation of a just society. This tradition drew from:
- **Robert Owen’s** utopian socialism.
- **The Rochdale Principles** (1844), which governed early British cooperatives.
- **The Social Gospel movement**, which argued that Christianity demanded economic justice.

**Key Institutions:**
- **The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (1924):** A farmer-owned cooperative that broke the monopoly of private grain companies, ensuring fair prices for producers. At its peak, it handled **60% of Canada’s wheat**.
- **Credit Unions:** Inspired by **Alphonse Desjardins’** *caisse populaire* model (Quebec, 1900), Prairie credit unions provided financial services to farmers and workers excluded by banks.
- **The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, 1932):** A socialist party that emerged from the **Regina Manifesto (1933)**, calling for public ownership of key industries. The CCF’s **Tommy Douglas** became Premier of Saskatchewan in **1944**, implementing North America’s first **public auto insurance** (1945) and **universal healthcare** (1962).

**The Doctors’ Strike (1962):**
When Douglas’ government introduced **Medicare**, Saskatchewan’s doctors **went on strike for 23 days**, arguing that socialized medicine violated their professional autonomy. The strike was broken when the government brought in **British doctors** to staff hospitals. The conflict revealed the ethical divide between **collective care** and **individualist professionalism**—a tension that persists in Canadian healthcare debates.

**Legacy:**
The cooperative movement redefined ethics as **democratic practice**, not just personal virtue. As historian **Ian MacPherson** (*Each for All*, 2009) argues, Prairie cooperatives were "schools of democracy," teaching farmers and workers that they could govern their own economic lives. Yet this tradition was not without its contradictions: cooperatives often excluded Indigenous and Métis communities, and their success depended on the same agricultural economy that displaced Indigenous peoples.

### **6. The Ethics of Settlement: Land, Dispossession, and Reckoning**
**The Dominion Lands Act (1872) and the Homestead System:**
The ethical foundations of Prairie settlement were built on **stolen land**. The *Dominion Lands Act* (1872) offered **160-acre homesteads** to settlers for a $10 fee—land that had been taken from Indigenous nations through the **Numbered Treaties** (1871–1921). Many settlers were acutely aware of this injustice. As **Mennonite leader David Toews** wrote in 1908:
> *"We came to Canada as refugees, and we were given land that was not the government’s to give. We must not forget that we are guests here."*

Yet few settler communities confronted this reality. Instead, they participated in the **erasure of Indigenous presence**, whether through:
- **The pass system** (1885–1951), which restricted Indigenous movement off reserves.
- **The suppression of Indigenous agriculture** (e.g., the **Peasant Farm Policy** in Saskatchewan, which forced Indigenous farmers to adopt European methods).
- **The residential school system**, which many settler communities (including Mennonites) staffed or supported.

**Reckoning with the Land:**
Some settler communities have begun to grapple with this history:
- **The Mennonite Church Canada** issued a **confession of complicity** in 2016, acknowledging that their settlement on Indigenous lands was "a form of theft."
- **The Doukhobor USCC** has engaged in **land acknowledgments** and dialogues with Indigenous communities, though their own history of displacement complicates these gestures.
- **The Ukrainian Canadian Congress** has supported **Truth and Reconciliation** initiatives, though the internment of Ukrainians remains a more prominent memory than their role in settler colonialism.

As historian **Frances Swyripa** (*Storied Landscapes*, 2010) argues, Prairie settlers’ ethical traditions were **both radical and complicit**: they challenged capitalism, militarism, and individualism, yet they did so on land from which Indigenous peoples were being violently removed.

### **Conclusion: The Prairie as Ethical Crucible**
The Prairie settler communities discussed here—Doukhobors, Mennonites, Hutterites, Ukrainians, and cooperative socialists—brought to Canada **radical ethical visions** that challenged the dominant norms of capitalism, militarism, and individualism. Yet their stories are not ones of unblemished virtue. They were:
- **Victims of state repression** (internment, forced assimilation, land restrictions).
- **Perpetrators of colonial violence** (settling on Indigenous lands, participating in cultural genocide).
- **Sites of internal conflict** (schisms over accommodation vs. resistance, tradition vs. assimilation).

Their ethical traditions remain vital, offering models of **communal living, pacifism, and mutual aid** that continue to inspire. But they also demand **honesty about complicity**—a reckoning that is still unfolding.

As **George Woodcock** wrote of the Doukhobors, their struggle was "not just against the state, but against the very idea of the state." The same could be said of all these communities: their ethics were **unsettling** in every sense of the word. They unsettled the norms of Canadian society, and they unsettled the land itself. Their legacy is not one of moral purity, but of **ethical courage in the face of impossible choices**.

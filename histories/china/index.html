<h1 id="china-known-gaps">China — Known Gaps</h1>
<p><em>Part of <a href="https://cottonwood.world">The Cottonwood Collection</a> — a public reference library on harm, care, and stewardship.</em></p>
<p><em>This page does not attempt to tell the story of Chinese intellectual and moral tradition. It explains why we haven&rsquo;t yet, and what we know we&rsquo;d need to do it honestly.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-this-page-is-different">Why This Page Is Different</h2>
<p>The Cottonwood Collection includes histories of <a href="/histories/canada/">Canada</a>, <a href="/histories/france/">France</a>, <a href="/histories/india/">India</a>, <a href="/histories/japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="/histories/mexico/">Mexico</a>, and the <a href="/histories/united-states/">United States</a>. Each was assembled using multiple AI providers answering structured research questions in English.</p>
<p>For China, this method is insufficient. We know this because we tested it.</p>
<p>When we asked the same questions about Chinese philosophical tradition that we asked about other civilizations, we received answers that were accurate at the syllabus level — correct names, correct dates, correct summaries — but that consistently missed a structural feature of the tradition itself: <strong>Chinese philosophy treats the productive tension between competing schools as a feature, not a bug.</strong></p>
<p>An English-language summary of Confucianism will give you <em>rén</em> (仁, benevolence). An English-language summary of Daoism will give you <em>wú wéi</em> (無為, non-action). What neither will give you — in English, reliably — is the fact that these two positions are in a deliberate, millennia-long argument with each other, and that <strong>the argument itself is the teaching.</strong></p>
<p>This is structurally identical to the Talmudic principle of <em>machloket l&rsquo;shem shamayim</em> — argument for the sake of heaven — where the minority opinion is preserved because the disagreement carries pedagogical weight that the resolution does not.</p>
<p>We could publish a page that passes a quiz on Chinese philosophy. We&rsquo;d rather publish a page that&rsquo;s honest about what we can&rsquo;t yet do well.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-we-know-were-missing">What We Know We&rsquo;re Missing</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-debate-is-the-tradition">1. The Debate Is the Tradition</h3>
<p>The standard Western presentation of Chinese philosophy treats each school as a separate entry: Confucianism here, Daoism there, Legalism over there, Mohism in a footnote. This is like presenting Judaism by separating Hillel from Shammai and filing them alphabetically.</p>
<p>The Chinese tradition has native frameworks for holding contradictions simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zhōngyōng (中庸)</strong> — the Doctrine of the Mean — which is not compromise but the construction of a possibility space that contains both extremes.</li>
<li><strong>Yīn-yáng (陰陽) complementarity</strong> — where opposition is not resolved but held as the engine of change.</li>
<li><strong>The Hundred Schools period (諸子百家)</strong> — where Confucian, Daoist, Mohist, Legalist, Logician, Agriculturalist, and other traditions coexisted and defined themselves partly through their disagreements with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>A cottonwood page on China would need to present the <em>Analects</em> and the <em>Zhuangzi</em> not as two books but as two voices in a conversation that has been running for twenty-five centuries. We don&rsquo;t yet have a format that does this without flattening it.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-language-carries-philosophy">2. The Language Carries Philosophy</h3>
<p>Classical Chinese (文言文) encodes philosophical distinctions in ways that do not survive translation. The character <strong>dé</strong> (德) — usually translated &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; — has an original meaning recoverable through oracle bone inscriptions that is substantially different from the Aristotelian concept &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; maps to in English. The character <strong>lǐ</strong> (禮) — usually translated &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; or &ldquo;propriety&rdquo; — functions in the <em>Xunzi</em> as what we might now call social technology, a designed system for channeling human desire into sustainable patterns. The English word &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; does not carry that meaning.</p>
<p>The depth of the commentary tradition — where a single passage from the <em>Analects</em> accumulates centuries of annotation, reinterpretation, and counter-argument — is flattened in translation. The <em>Xúnzǐ</em>&rsquo;s theory of <strong>zhèngmíng</strong> (正名, the rectification of names) argues that precise language is itself a moral technology. We take that claim seriously enough to acknowledge that our tools are not yet precise enough.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-texts-wed-need">3. The Texts We&rsquo;d Need</h3>
<p>Based on our research, a credible treatment of Chinese intellectual and moral history would require engagement with at minimum:</p>
<p><strong>Foundational texts:</strong>
- <em>Lúnyǔ</em> (論語, Analects) — not as Confucian catechism but as a record of situational ethical reasoning where the same question receives different answers depending on who asks
- <em>Mèngzǐ</em> (孟子, Mencius) — the moral psychology of the &ldquo;four sprouts&rdquo; (<em>sìduān</em>, 四端) and the argument that ethical capacity is innate but requires cultivation
- <em>Dàodéjīng</em> (道德經) — particularly in light of the Guodian and Mawangdui manuscript discoveries that changed scholarly understanding of the text&rsquo;s composition and dating
- <em>Zhuāngzǐ</em> (莊子, inner chapters) — the <em>Qíwùlùn</em> (齊物論, &ldquo;On the Equality of Things&rdquo;) as a radical epistemological argument, not merely as literary Daoism
- <em>Xúnzǐ</em> (荀子) — ritual as social technology, the rectification of names as philosophy of language, the argument that human nature is malleable rather than fixed
- <em>Mòzǐ</em> (墨子) — the Three Standards (<em>sānbiǎo fǎ</em>, 三表法) as an early methodology for evaluating claims through historical precedent, empirical verification, and practical application — what might now be called algorithmic ethics
- <em>Hán Fēizǐ</em> (韓非子) — the tripartite theory of law (<em>fǎ</em>, 法), statecraft (<em>shù</em>, 術), and positional power (<em>shì</em>, 勢), and its systematic critique of Confucian governance
- <em>Yìjīng Xìcí zhuàn</em> (易經繫辭傳) — the cosmological and metaphysical framework that influenced all subsequent Chinese thought about change, pattern, and natural order</p>
<p><strong>Historical and reference texts:</strong>
- <em>Yílǐ</em> (儀禮) and <em>Lǐjì</em> (禮記) — the ritual texts, including the philosophically rich <em>Zhōngyōng</em> and <em>Dàxué</em> chapters
- <em>Huáinánzǐ</em> (淮南子) — the Han-dynasty synthesis of Daoist, Confucian, and Legalist thought that demonstrates these traditions were never as separate as textbook presentations suggest
- <em>Zīzhì Tōngjiàn</em> (資治通鑑) — Sima Guang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government,&rdquo; where historiography itself is a form of moral reasoning
- <em>Hànshū Yìwénzhì</em> (漢書藝文志) — the bibliographic chapter of the Book of Han, which classifies knowledge into categories (<em>jīng/shǐ/zǐ/jí</em> — classics, history, masters, collections) that themselves encode an epistemology about what kinds of knowledge matter and how they relate</p>
<p><strong>Interpretive tradition:</strong>
- <em>Jìnsīlù</em> (近思錄) — Zhu Xi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reflections on Things at Hand,&rdquo; which functions as a Neo-Confucian curriculum and demonstrates how the tradition actively curated its own transmission
- <em>Míngrú Xué&rsquo;àn</em> (明儒學案) — Huang Zongxi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Records of Ming Scholars,&rdquo; an innovation in intellectual history that organized thought by school and tracked internal dissent within traditions
- Féng Yǒulán&rsquo;s <em>History of Chinese Philosophy</em> (中國哲學史) — the first major attempt to periodize Chinese philosophy using both Chinese and Western categories, with all the tensions that implies</p>
<h3 id="4-the-classification-problem">4. The Classification Problem</h3>
<p>The Cottonwood Collection organizes histories by contemporary nation-state. This is already an acknowledged compromise — we said so in our <a href="https://github.com/the-hpl-company/cottonwood">commit message</a>. For China, the problem is compounded:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Chinese philosophy&rdquo; includes traditions that predate any entity called &ldquo;China&rdquo; by centuries.</li>
<li>The tradition spans what are now multiple nation-states (the Confucian tradition shaped Korea, Japan, and Vietnam as deeply as it shaped China).</li>
<li>The name &ldquo;China&rdquo; is itself exonymic — from Sanskrit <em>Cīna</em> through Persian, not from any Chinese self-designation. The country calls itself <strong>Zhōngguó</strong> (中國).</li>
</ul>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t solved this. We&rsquo;re noting it.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-we-cant-get-from-english-language-sources">5. What We Can&rsquo;t Get From English-Language Sources</h3>
<p>We tested this directly. When we asked AI models about each of the texts listed above in English, every model could produce accurate summaries. None failed outright. But the responses consistently exhibited a pattern: each text was treated as an isolated encyclopedia entry rather than as a participant in an ongoing argument.</p>
<p>For example: the <em>Xunzi</em>&rsquo;s theory of ritual as social technology, the <em>Mozi</em>&rsquo;s Three Standards as algorithmic ethics, and the <em>Han Feizi</em>&rsquo;s critique of virtue-based governance are three competing answers to the same question — <em>how should human behavior be organized?</em> — but English-language sources reliably present them as three separate topics.</p>
<p>The Chinese philosophical tradition has a term for what we&rsquo;re describing: <strong>lǐ yī fēn shū</strong> (理一分殊) — &ldquo;principle is one, its manifestations are many.&rdquo; The principle is the question. The manifestations are the schools. You cannot understand the manifestations without the principle, and you cannot find the principle in an encyclopedia that alphabetizes the manifestations.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-honest-coverage-would-require">What Honest Coverage Would Require</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Native-language engagement.</strong> The commentary tradition, the semantic range of key terms, and the argumentative structure of the texts require engagement in classical and modern Chinese that goes beyond translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A presentation format that preserves tension.</strong> Cottonwood&rsquo;s current format — single-page narratives organized chronologically — may not be adequate. Chinese philosophy may require a format closer to the Talmudic page: central text surrounded by commentary, counter-commentary, and cross-references that make the disagreement visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration with scholars who work in the tradition.</strong> This is not something we can build alone. We&rsquo;d rather say so than pretend otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="a-note-on-what-this-page-is">A Note on What This Page Is</h2>
<p>This page is itself a demonstration of the editorial standard the Cottonwood Collection aspires to. We believe that an honest accounting of what we don&rsquo;t know is more valuable than a confident presentation of what we&rsquo;ve half-learned. The gaps described here are not embarrassments — they are the roadmap.</p>
<p>If you work in Chinese philosophy, classical Chinese literature, or comparative ethics and want to help build this page properly, the <a href="https://github.com/the-hpl-company/cottonwood">source repository</a> is open.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Cottonwood Collection is a public reference library. It is not an encyclopedia, not a textbook, and not a replacement for primary sources. It is an index — an attempt to teach not just the tool but what the tool is for.</em></p>

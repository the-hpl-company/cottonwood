The classical period (c. 300 BCE - 600 CE) marks a zenith in the systematic articulation of Indian ethical traditions across philosophical, literary, and legal domains. Below is an analysis of key texts and themes, grounded in specific textual citations and scholarly interpretations:

---

### 1. **The Mahabharata as Ethical Laboratory**
The Mahabharata is a vast ethical tapestry, exploring dilemmas of duty, justice, and harm.

- **Bhagavad Gita (Bhishma Parva, Chapters 25–42)**  
   Arjuna’s dilemma (BG 1.28–47) epitomizes the conflict between *svadharma* (personal duty) and *ahimsa* (non-violence). Krishna’s response emphasizes *nishkama karma* (action without attachment to results, BG 2.47) and the transcendent nature of the self (BG 2.20), framing ethics as a means to spiritual liberation.

- **Shanti Parva (Book 12)**  
   Bhishma’s teachings on governance (*rajadharma*) include:
     - **Justice for the weak** (12.56.32): “The king should protect the poor and the weak, for they have no protector.”
     - **Ethics of punishment** (12.15.25): “Punishment should be proportional and administered without malice.”

- **Anushasana Parva (Book 13)**  
   Detailed discussions on *dharma* include:
     - **Charity as duty** (13.6): Giving to those in need is a moral obligation.
     - **Non-violence** (13.8): Ahimsa is the highest dharma.

- **Svargarohanika Parva (Book 18)**  
   Yudhishthira’s refusal to enter heaven without the dog (18.3) symbolizes loyalty and compassion for all beings, transcending caste and species hierarchies.

### 2. **The Ramayana — Dharma and Its Discontents**
The Ramayana explores the ethics of kingship and social order.

- **Rama as Dharma Incarnate**  
   Rama’s exile (Ayodhya Kanda) exemplifies adherence to *kshatriya dharma* (warrior duty) and filial obedience. His abandonment of Sita (Uttara Kanda) raises questions about gender justice and the cost of maintaining social order. For instance:
     - Sita’s trial by fire (Yuddha Kanda, 116.17–30) is justified as a test of purity but remains ethically troubling.
     - Uttara Kanda’s narrative of Sita’s banishment critiques Rama’s adherence to *dharma* at the expense of individual suffering.

---

### 3. **Manusmriti — Dharma’s Hierarchies**
The Manusmriti systematizes *varnashrama dharma* (caste and life-stage duties) but also encodes hierarchical oppression.

- **Hierarchy of Obligations**  
   - Brahmins (1.88–91): Duty to study and teach.
   - Shudras (1.91): Serve the twice-born.
   - “Untouchables” (10.51–56): Excluded from ritual and social life.

- **Treatment of Women**  
   - Women’s dependence (5.147–148): “A woman is never fit for independence.”
   - Gender hierarchy (9.3): “A husband is a god to his wife.”

- **Ambedkar’s Critique**  
   Ambedkar’s burning of the Manusmriti (1927) symbolized rejection of its oppressive norms. He argued for Buddhist egalitarianism as an alternative.

### 4. **Arthashastra — Ethics of Statecraft**
Kautilya’s Arthashastra combines pragmatic statecraft with ethical considerations.

- **Ethical Pragmatism**  
   - **Welfare of subjects** (1.19.34): “The happiness of the king lies in the happiness of his subjects.”
   - **Espionage** (1.12): Spying is justified for state security.
   - **Warfare** (10.3): Ethical limits on war conduct.

Unlike Machiavelli, Kautilya integrates dharma into statecraft, emphasizing the king’s duty to protect all subjects.

### 5. **Nagarjuna’s Madhyamaka — Emptiness and Ethics**
Nagarjuna’s *shunyata* (emptiness) challenges inherent existence but grounds ethics in interdependence.

- **Ethical Implications**  
   - **Compassion** (*Upayakausalya Sutra*): Emptiness reveals the interconnectedness of all beings, motivating compassion.
   - **Non-attachment** (*Mulamadhyamakakarika* 24.18): Ethical action arises from wisdom, not attachment to results.

---

### 6. **Tamil Sangam Literature — Thirukkural**
Thiruvalluvar’s Thirukkural offers a distinct ethical vision.

- **Virtue, Wealth, and Love**  
   - **Virtue** (Chapter 1): “The foundation of dharma is compassion.”
   - **Wealth** (Chapter 39): Ethical governance ensures prosperity.
   - **Love** (Chapter 3): Celebrates human relationships.

Unlike Sanskrit traditions, Thirukkural emphasizes social equality and practical ethics.

### 7. **Key Scholars**
- **Sheldon Pollock**: Explores the ideological functions of epic literature (*The Language of the Gods in the World of Men*).
- **Romila Thapar**: Analyzes historical contexts of texts (*Early India: From Origins to AD 1300*).
- **Wendy Doniger**: Focuses on narrative ethics and gender (*The Hindus: An Alternative History*).
- **Patrick Olivelle**: Translates and interprets Dharmashastras (*Manu’s Code of Law*).
- **B.R. Ambedkar**: Critiques caste and advocates Buddhist egalitarianism (*Annihilation of Caste*).

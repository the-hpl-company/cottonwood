### **The Classical Period (c. 300 BCE – 600 CE): The Systematic Flowering of Indian Ethical Thought**

This era witnessed the crystallization of India’s foundational ethical systems within a landscape of intense debate between orthodox (āstika) and heterodox (nāstika) traditions. The following analysis presents these traditions through their primary texts, internal tensions, and enduring dialogues.

---

#### **1. The Mahābhārata as Ethical Laboratory**
The epic (c. 400 BCE–400 CE) is a vast narrative exploration of *dharma* (duty, justice, order) in crisis, where conflicting duties create insoluble dilemmas (*āpaddharma*).

*   **Bhagavad Gītā (Bhīṣma Parva, 23–40): The Foundational Dilemma**
    The Gītā frames the epic’s core conflict: Arjuna’s anguish over killing elders and kin (*svajanavadha*) versus his duty (*svadharma*) as a Kṣatriya warrior. Krishna’s response synthesizes three paths: disciplined action (*karmayoga*, 2.47-48, 3.8), knowledge (*jñānayoga*), and devotion (*bhaktiyoga*). The ethical pivot is acting without attachment to results (*niṣkāma karma*): “Your right is to action alone, never to its fruits” (2.47). This reframes violence not as personal desire but as a detached duty within a cosmic cycle, a contested resolution that has fueled millennia of commentary.

*   **Śānti Parva & Anuśāsana Parva: The Post-War Treatise**
    After the war, the dying Bhīṣma instructs Yudhiṣṭhira on kingship (*rājadharma*), emergency ethics (*āpaddharma*), and ultimate liberation (*mokṣadharma*). These books systematize political ethics. A king’s paramount duty is protection (*rakṣaṇa*) of subjects, especially the vulnerable (*āpadgrastha*): “The king is made for the sake of the *dharma* of the people, and not the people for the sake of the king” (Śānti Parva 12.92.5). Justice (*daṇḍanīti*) must be impartial, like a father to all (12.91).

*   **Svargārohaṇika Parva: The Final Test**
    Yudhiṣṭhira’s refusal to enter heaven without the faithful dog who accompanied him (a disguised form of *Dharma* himself) is the epic’s ultimate ethical statement. He declares, “It is evil to abandon one who is devoted” (17.3.7). This act of loyalty to a lowly creature—contrasted with his earlier abandonment of family—prioritizes personal compassion (*dayā*) and faithfulness over ritualistic merit. It serves as a narrative critique of a rigid, impersonal *dharma*.

#### **2. The Rāmāyaṇa: Dharma of the King vs. Ethics of the Person**
Vālmīki’s epic (c. 200 BCE–200 CE) presents Rāma as the ideal man (*maryādā puruṣottama*) whose life is a performance of *dharma*, yet this performance generates profound ethical tensions.

*   **The Ideal King (Rāmarājya):** Rāma’s rule is the archetype of just, peaceful governance where *dharma* protects all. His primary duty is to his subjects.
*   **The Cost of Dharma:** This ideal demands severe personal sacrifices: his exile (Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa) upholds his father’s word; his later abandonment of Sīta (Uttara Kāṇḍa 7, *sarga* 42-44) upholds public perception of royal propriety. Sīta’s question—“What fault of mine is there?” (7.44.13)—stands as a powerful indictment of a *dharma* that sacrifices the individual (particularly the woman) for social order. The Uttara Kāṇḍa, likely a later addition, deeply troubles the narrative, exposing the violence inherent in a *dharma* absolutized for statecraft.

#### **3. The Manusmṛti: Systematic Hierarchy and Contested Authority**
The *Mānavadharmaśāstra* (c. 2nd century BCE–3rd century CE), attributed to the sage Manu, is the most influential and controversial *dharmaśāstra*. Its “internal logic” is a comprehensive, hierarchical social cosmology.

*   **System of Obligations (Varṇāśramadharma):** Duties are meticulously prescribed by birth (*varṇa*) and life stage (*āśrama*). The text’s core is protection through differentiation: “For the prosperity of the worlds, he [the Creator] caused the Brahmin, the Kṣatriya, the Vaiśya, and the Śūdra to proceed from his mouth, his arms, his thighs, and his feet” (1.31).
*   **Treatment of Women and Śūdras:** The hierarchy is explicit and punitive. A woman is to be dependent: in childhood on her father, in youth on her husband, in old age on her sons (9.3). Śūdras are barred from Vedic study, with severe penalties: “If a Śūdra listens intentionally to the Veda, his ears shall be filled with molten tin or lac” (8.272).
*   **The “Untouchable” (Cāṇḍāla):** Those outside the system are defined by extreme pollution: “The dwellings of the Cāṇḍālas shall be outside the village… their wealth shall be dogs and donkeys” (10.51-52).
*   **Ambedkar’s Counter-Text:** Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, architect of India’s constitution and a Dalit leader, publicly burned the Manusmṛti on December 25, 1927, in Mahad. He denounced it as the ideological foundation of the caste system, a “document of slavery” that codified graded inequality and violence. This act symbolizes the text’s dual legacy: as a prescriptive Brahmanical ideal and as a instrument of historical oppression.

#### **4. The Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya: Realpolitik with a Dharma Frame**
Attributed to Kauṭilya (c. 3rd century BCE–3rd century CE), this treatise on statecraft (*daṇḍanīti*) presents a starkly pragmatic ethics for the preservation of the state (*rājya*).

*   **Ethical Pragmatism:** The king’s duty is the state’s security and prosperity. This justifies espionage, assassination, and deceit (*indrajāla*). Advisors should be tested by “the four traps” of lust, anger, greed, and fear (1.10). Unlike Machiavelli’s *Prince*, which separates politics from Christian morality, Kauṭilya’s pragmatism operates **within** the *dharma* framework. The king is the *dharmapravartaka* (upholder of *dharma*) and his success (*yoga-kṣema*) ensures social order. The “circle of kings” (*maṇḍala* theory, Book 6) advocates a dynamic, self-interested foreign policy, but the ultimate goal is stability (*śreyaḥ*) for the realm.
*   **Specificity:** It details welfare: state intervention during famines, protection of merchants, care for animals, and justice for slaves (2.1, 3.13, 4.13). Harm (*hiṃsā*) is instrumentally justified for the greater good of the state, creating a tension between *dharma* and *artha* never fully resolved.

#### **5. Nāgārjuna’s Mādhyamaka: Emptiness as the Ground of Ethics**
The Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (c. 150–250 CE), in his *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*, argues all phenomena are “empty” (*śūnya*) of inherent, independent existence (*svabhāva*).

*   **Ethical Implications:** If nothing exists independently, what grounds morality? For Nāgārjuna, emptiness (*śūnyatā*) is not nihilism but **interdependence** (*pratītyasamutpāda*). In *Ratnāvalī* (5:67-68), he states: “Since the person is not real, neither is the property. Therefore, why would one protect a non-real person with non-real property?… However, until one realizes [emptiness], one should practice virtue.” Ethics is conventionally real and necessary on the path. Compassion (*karuṇā*) arises naturally from the insight that all suffering beings are interconnected and equally empty of a separate self. Morality is grounded in conventional reality (*saṃvṛtisatya*) and the bodhisattva’s vow to liberate all beings.

#### **6. Tamil Sangam Literature: The Independent Voice of the Thirukkuṟaḷ**
The *Thirukkuṟaḷ* by Thiruvalluvar (c. 1st century BCE–5th century CE) is a seminal Tamil ethical text, structured into 133 chapters on *Aram* (virtue, *dharma*), *Porul* (wealth, *artha*), and *Inbam* (love, *kāma*).

*   **Relation to Sanskrit Traditions:** It shares the *trivarga* framework but demonstrates significant divergence. It is notably **silent on caste by birth** and ritual purity. Virtue (*Aram*) is universalized: “All humans are equal by birth; it is their conduct that creates differences” (Kūṟaḷ 972, on *Kulaṉ* – lineage). The king’s duty is to “provide for his people, to guard them, and to reap from them the revenue” (Kūṟaḷ 385), a pragmatic view akin to the Arthaśāstra but without its sanction for deceit.
*   **Divergence:** Its treatment of love (*Inbam*) is a sophisticated, human-centered psychology of both conjugal and illicit love, standing apart from Sanskrit *kāmaśāstra*. Its egalitarian spirit and focus on personal virtue (*aṟam*) over ritual have led scholars like K. Kailasapathy to see it as a product of a mercantile, urban culture distinct from Brahmanical rural orthodoxy.

#### **7. Key Scholarly Lenses**
*   **Sheldon Pollock:** Analyzes the “political philology” of the Rāmāyaṇa and the concept of *rājadharma*, arguing for the “aestheticization of power” and the deployment of Sanskrit as a “language of the gods” for political ends.
*   **Romila Thapar:** Historian who contextualizes these texts within social and economic structures, questioning monolithic “Hinduism” and highlighting the tensions between the ascetic and householder, the orthodox and the dissenter.
*   **Wendy Doniger:** Employs comparative mythology and psychoanalysis to uncover subversive, pluralistic narratives beneath orthodox interpretations, particularly in the Mahābhārata and Manusmṛti.
*   **Patrick Olivelle:** Leading philologist and translator of the *dharmaśāstras* and Arthaśāstra, providing critical editions that reveal textual layers, historical contexts, and evolving legal concepts.
*   **B.R. Ambedkar:** The essential counter-scholar. In *Annihilation of Caste* (1936) and *Who Were the Shudras?* (1946), he performs a radical critique from the oppressed, arguing that Brahmanical texts like Manusmṛti are not spiritual guides but ideological tools of a graded, hierarchical social system that requires annihilation, not reform.

**Conclusion:** The classical period does not present a unified “Indian ethics.” It presents a contested field where the *dharma* of hierarchy and duty (Manu, parts of the epics) contends with the ethics of compassion and emptiness (Buddhism, the Mahābhārata’s final test), the pragmatism of statecraft (Kauṭilya), and the independent humanism of the Tamil tradition. The enduring legacy is this very debate—the constant negotiation between social order (*dharma*) and the moral claims of the individual, the vulnerable, and the excluded.

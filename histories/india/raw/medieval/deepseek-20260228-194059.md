# Medieval Indian Ethical Transformations (c. 600–1700 CE): Bhakti, Islamic Arrival, and Synthesis

## 1. The Bhakti Revolution: Egalitarian Devotion vs. Caste Structure

**Tamil Bhakti Foundations (6th–9th centuries CE)**
- **Alvars (Vishnu devotees)** and **Nayanars (Shiva devotees)**: Composed Tamil hymns collected as *Divya Prabandham* (4,000 verses) and *Tevaram* respectively.
- **Radical egalitarianism**: Nayanar saint **Nandanar** (Dalit agricultural laborer) gains access to Chidambaram Temple through Shiva's grace (*Periya Puranam* 6.3). Alvar saint **Tiruppan Alvar** (Dalit bard) carried into Srirangam Temple by Brahmins (*Divya Prabandham*, *Amalanadipiran*).
- **Philosophical challenge**: Replaces Vedic ritual eligibility with emotional surrender (*prapatti*). **Karaikkal Ammaiyar** (female Nayanar) declares caste irrelevant before Shiva (*Arputat Tiruvantati* 45).

**Virashaiva Movement (12th century Karnataka)**
- **Basavanna** (1105–1167 CE): Minister turned reformer, authored *Vachanas* (prose poems).
- **Anubhava Mantapa** (Hall of Experience): Open debating forum including women and Dalits.
- **Direct challenge**: "The rich will make temples for Shiva. What shall I, a poor man, do? My legs are pillars, my body the shrine" (*Vachana* 820). Rejects temple hierarchy, establishes *linga* on every body.
- **Practical dismantling**: Created parallel institutions—communal burial (*samadhi*), rejection of Brahmin death rites, inter-caste marriages documented in *Basava Purana*.

**North Indian Bhakti (14th–17th centuries)**
- **Kabir** (1398–1448 CE, Varanasi): Weaver by caste, verses in *Bijak* and *Adi Granth*. "If you say you're a Brahmin born of a mother, why didn't you come by another way?" (*Bijak*, *Ramaini* 9). Attacks both Hindu and Islamic orthodoxy.
- **Ravidas** (c. 1450–1520 CE, Varanasi): Chamar (leather-worker) saint, 41 hymns in *Guru Granth Sahib*. "A family that has a true follower of the Lord is neither high caste nor low caste, lordly or poor" (*Guru Granth Sahib* 486).
- **Mirabai** (c. 1498–1547 CE): Rajput princess who rejects royal norms, sings to Krishna as husband.
- **Tukaram** (1608–1650 CE, Maharashtra): Shudra grocer, authored *Abhanga* poetry, challenged Brahmin monopoly on scripture.

**Scholarly Assessment (Lorenzen, 2005)**: Bhakti created **counter-cultural communities** but rarely transformed mainstream caste structure. Parallel spiritual equality coexisted with social inequality—what M.G.S. Narayanan calls "**inclusion without dissolution**." The **limitation**: Bhakti saints often needed upper-caste patrons (Ramananda accepted Kabir but didn't reject caste).

## 2. Islamic Ethical Traditions: Sufism and Philosophical Engagement

**Sufi Orders and Ethical Practices**
- **Chishti Order** (13th century onward): **Moinuddin Chishti** (Ajmer, d. 1236) emphasized *sama* (music), *khidmat* (service). **Nizamuddin Auliya** (Delhi, d. 1325) fed thousands daily regardless of faith (*Fawa'id al-Fu'ad* conversations).
- **Suhrawardi Order**: **Baha-ud-din Zakariya** (Multan, d. 1267) combined spiritual authority with political engagement.
- **Naqshbandi Order** (16th century): **Ahmad Sirhindi** (d. 1624) rejected syncretism, emphasized Sharia.

**Key Ethical Concepts**
- **Khidmat** (service) vs. **seva**: Sufi kitchen (*langar*) at **Ajmer Dargah** paralleled Sikh *langar* and Hindu temple *annadanam*. Shared practice of feeding poor.
- **Fana** (annihilation in God): Parallels Hindu *moksha*, Buddhist *nirvana*.

**Al-Biruni's Engagement (973–1048 CE)**
- **Kitab al-Hind** (1030 CE): Arabic survey of Indian sciences and religion.
- **Methodology**: Learned Sanskrit, translated Patanjali's *Yoga Sutras*, Euclid into Sanskrit.
- **Ethical observation**: Criticized caste as social injustice but admired Hindu philosophical depth. Genuine **comparative philosophy** before colonialism.

## 3. Akbar's Synthesis: Din-i Ilahi and Sulh-i Kul

**Ibadat Khana Debates (1575–1582 CE, Fatehpur Sikri)**
- Participants: Hindu Brahmins, Jains, Zoroastrians, Portuguese Jesuits, Sunni/Shia scholars.
- **Record**: Jesuit accounts (*Mission to the Mughal*), Badauni's critical *Muntakhab-ut-Tawarikh*.
- **Outcome**: Akbar's disillusionment with sectarianism leads to **sulh-i kul** (universal peace).

**Din-i Ilahi (1582 CE)**
- Not a new religion but ethical fellowship. **Four pillars**: 1) Protection of all life (vegetarianism), 2) Universal tolerance, 3) Reason over tradition, 4) Sun veneration (Zoroastrian influence).
- **Membership**: 19 nobles, Hindu rituals included (*siyaha*—fire ceremony).
- **Failure reasons** (Muzaffar Alam): 1) Too elite, no mass base, 2) Undermined ulama authority, 3) No institutional structure after Akbar.

**Legal Synthesis**: *Mahzar* (1579) made Akbar interpreter of Islamic law, allowing Hindu customs in court.

## 4. Dara Shikoh: Vedanta-Sufi Synthesis

**Translations and Works**
- **Sirr-i-Akbar** (1657): Persian translation of 52 Upanishads. Preface argues Upanishads are "the hidden book" (*kitab al-maknun*) mentioned in Quran 56:78.
- **Majma-ul-Bahrain** (1655): "The Mingling of Two Oceans"—systematic comparison of Sufi and Vedanta terminology.
- **Safinat al-Auliya** and **Sakinat al-Auliya**: Biographies of Sufis and saints.

**Thesis**: Identifies Hindu *Advaita* concept of *Brahman* with Sufi *Wahdat al-Wujud* (Unity of Being) of Ibn Arabi.

**Execution (1659)**: Ordered by brother Aurangzeb after war of succession. **Symbolism**: Not just political but **theological**—Aurangzeb backed by orthodox ulama who declared Dara's synthesis heretical. Sirhindi's Naqshbandi order particularly opposed.

## 5. Sikh Ethics: Nanak's Radical Synthesis

**Guru Nanak (1469–1539 CE)**
- **Core critique**: "There is no Hindu, no Muslim" (*Guru Granth Sahib* 1132)—challenges identity based on ritual.
- **Ethical practices**: 
  1. **Langar** (communal kitchen): Institutionalized by Guru Amar Das (1479–1574). All sit in straight rows (*pangat*), eat same food.
  2. **Three pillars**: *Naam Japna* (meditation), *Kirat Karni* (honest labor), *Vand Chakna* (sharing).
  3. **Guru Granth Sahib** (1604): Includes hymns of Hindu bhaktas (Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas) and Sufis (Farid).

**Khalsa (1699, Guru Gobind Singh)**
- **Ethics of armed defense**: *Sant Sipahi* (saint-soldier). "When all other means fail, it is righteous to draw the sword" (*Zafarnama*).
- **Protection of vulnerable**: Historical role in defending non-combatants during persecution.

## 6. Tension: Syncretism vs. Orthodoxy

**Hindu Revivalism**
- **Shankaracharya traditions** (8th century onward): Advaita monasteries (*mathas*) maintained caste boundaries even while philosophically egalitarian.
- **Medieval commentators**: **Madhusudana Sarasvati** (16th century) wrote *Advaitasiddhi* defending Advaita against dualists, but within Brahminical framework.

**Islamic Orthodoxy**
- **Ahmad Sirhindi** (1564–1624): *Naqshbandi* revivalist, wrote *Maktubat* criticizing Akbar's policies, emphasized Sharia.
- **Aurangzeb** (r. 1658–1707): *Fatawa-e-Alamgiri* (1664) codified Hanafi law, reinstated *jizya* (1679), limited temple construction.

**Persistent Counter-Tradition**
- **Bhakti-Sufi synthesis**: **Mansur al-Hallaj's** *ana al-haqq* ("I am Truth") echoed in Punjabi Sufi **Bulleh Shah** (1680–1757) and Hindu *aham brahmasmi*.
- **Shared spaces**: **Khanqah of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus** (Gwalior) included yoga practices. **Dargah of Moinuddin Chishti** visited by Hindus and Muslims alike.

## 7. Key Scholarly Debates

**Sheldon Pollock** (*The Language of the Gods in the World of Men*): Argues Sanskrit became "cosmopolitan" then "vernacular" but questions whether pre-colonial India had true "secular" space.

**Audrey Truschke** (*Culture of Encounters*): Documents extensive Sanskrit-Persian translation projects under Mughals, showing deeper engagement than conflict model suggests.

**Muzaffar Alam** (*The Languages of Political Islam*): Shows how Persianate ethics adapted to Indian context—*akhlāq* literature incorporating Indian wisdom.

**David Lorenzen** (*Bhakti Religion in North India*): Distinguishes between "nirguna" (formless) bhakti that challenged caste more radically vs. "saguna" (with form) that accommodated it.

---

**Conclusion**: Medieval India saw **ethical innovation through contact**, not isolation. Bhakti's spiritual equality rarely translated to social revolution. Islamic traditions brought new concepts of service (*khidmat*) and law (*sharia*). Synthesis attempts (Akbar, Dara) were elite-driven and vulnerable to orthodox backlash. Yet the **everyday ethics of shared spaces** (langars, dargahs, festivals) created durable pluralistic practices that outlasted political projects. The fundamental tension remained: **universalist ethics vs. particularist identities**—a debate that would intensify under colonialism.

# Contemporary Indian Ethical Thought (1950–Present): A Text-Grounded Analysis

## 1. The Indian Constitution as Ethical Document: Ambedkar’s Architecture

**Primary Text:** *The Constitution of India* (adopted 26 November 1949, effective 26 January 1950), drafted by the Constituent Assembly (1946–1949) with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as Chairman of the Drafting Committee.

**Ambedkar’s Ethical Vision:** Ambedkar framed the Constitution as a **"socio-economic document"** aimed at dismantling the hierarchical structure of caste (*varna-jati*) and establishing **constitutional morality** as a substitute for traditional Hindu social morality. In his final Constituent Assembly speech (25 November 1949), he warned: "In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality… We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment."

**Key Provisions as Ethical Legislation:**
- **Article 17** (Abolition of Untouchability): Directly criminalizes the practice of untouchability, rendering it a **"constitutional sin"** rather than merely a social evil. The *Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955* (later strengthened as the *Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1976*) operationalizes this.
- **Article 21** (Right to Life and Personal Liberty): Interpreted expansively by the Supreme Court to include **"right to dignity"** (*Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India*, 1978), **"right to clean environment"** (*Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar*, 1991), and **"right to die with dignity"** (*Common Cause v. Union of India*, 2018). This reflects a **dharmic expansion** of life beyond mere existence.
- **Article 51A** (Fundamental Duties): Added by the 42nd Amendment (1976), includes duties to **"renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women"** (clause e) and **"protect and improve the natural environment"** (clause g). This introduces a *swadharma* (personal duty) framework into constitutional law.

**Tension Between Rights and Directive Principles:** The **Fundamental Rights** (Part III) are justiciable, while the **Directive Principles of State Policy** (Part IV) are non-justiciable but fundamental to governance. This creates an ethical tension: individual liberty vs. social welfare. The Supreme Court has bridged this through the **"harmonious construction"** doctrine, reading Directive Principles into Rights (e.g., *Unni Krishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh*, 1993, deriving right to education from Article 21).

## 2. The Ongoing Caste Struggle: Reservations as Ethical Repair

**Legal Framework:** **Articles 15(4), 16(4), 46** enable reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The *Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019* introduced 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), controversially excluding caste criteria.

**The Mandal Commission (1979–1990):** Headed by B.P. Mandal, recommended 27% reservation for OBCs in government jobs. Implementation in 1990 by Prime Minister V.P. Singh triggered nationwide protests and self-immolations by upper-caste youth, revealing deep ethical conflict: **meritocracy vs. restorative justice**.

**Rohith Vemula (2016):** A Dalit PhD scholar at University of Hyderabad whose suicide note stated, "My birth is my fatal accident." His death exposed **institutionalized caste discrimination** in higher education. The subsequent *Rohith Act* (proposed) demands an anti-discrimination law for campuses.

**Dalit Literature as Ethical Testimony:**
- **Omprakash Valmiki’s *Joothan* (1997):** Autobiography detailing the ethics of **"pollution"**—being forced to eat *joothan* (leftovers) as a Balmiki (sweeper caste). He writes: "The pain of being Dalit is that you have to live your life as a *joothan*."
- **Bama’s *Karukku* (1992):** First Dalit woman’s autobiography in Tamil, documenting **"two-ness"**—Christian theology vs. caste practice within Indian Christianity. She describes the ethical rupture: "They said God created all equal. Then why do we have to bow to them?"

**Persistence of Caste Violence:** The *Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989* (amended 2015) criminalizes specific caste-based violence. Yet, National Crime Records Bureau data shows **an average of 40,000 atrocities annually** (2018–2022), indicating the gap between constitutional ethics and social reality.

## 3. Environmental Ethics: From Chipko to Climate Justice

**Chipko Movement (1973):** Led by Sunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt in Uttarakhand, women hugged trees to prevent logging. Bahuguna articulated it as ***prakriti purush* (nature as masculine)** vs. **ecological feminism**, drawing from the Bhagavad Gita’s *sthitaprajna* (stable intellect) concept.

**Narmada Bachao Andolan (1985–present):** Led by Medha Patkar against the Sardar Sarovar Dam. The Supreme Court’s 2000 judgment (*Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India*) prioritized **"development"** over displacement, but Justice Bharucha’s dissent invoked the **"precautionary principle"** from international environmental law.

**Bhopal Disaster (1984):** Union Carbide gas leak killed 15,000+; an ethical catastrophe of **corporate negligence vs. human rights**. The 1989 settlement ($470 million) was criticized as inadequate. Ongoing litigation highlights **transnational accountability gaps**.

**Vandana Shiva’s Bioethics:** In *Biopiracy: The Plunder of Nature and Knowledge* (1997), she critiques Western patents as **"intellectual piracy"** and advocates **seed sovereignty** based on the *Navdanya* (nine seeds) movement, framing biodiversity as **commons** vs. **commodity**.

**Legal Recognition:** The Supreme Court in *T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India* (1996) established the **"precautionary principle"** and **"public trust doctrine"** as part of Indian environmental jurisprudence.

## 4. Technology Ethics: Aadhaar, AI, and Digital Labor

**Aadhaar (2009–present):** The world’s largest biometric ID system, covering 1.3+ billion people. The *Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016* was challenged on privacy grounds. In *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* (2017), the Supreme Court upheld Aadhaar but limited its mandatory use, affirming **privacy as a fundamental right** under Article 21.

**Ethical Concerns:** **Exclusion errors** in welfare delivery (documented by Jean Drèze and Reetika Khera), **data surveillance**, and **profiling risks**. The technology encodes a **utilitarian ethics** (efficiency) that may conflict with **dignitarian ethics** (autonomy).

**AI Development:** Companies like **Sarvam AI** (focused on Indian languages) and **Krutrim** (by Ola) raise questions of **whose ethics are embedded**. India’s *National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence* (2018) emphasizes "AI for All" but lacks a binding regulatory framework.

**IT Sector Labor Ethics:** The **"996" culture** (9 AM–9 PM, 6 days/week) in tech parks conflicts with the **Factories Act, 1948** and the **right to dignity**. The *IT/ITES Industry (Standing Orders) Rules* remain weakly enforced.

## 5. Hindu Nationalism (Hindutva) as Ethical Framework

**RSS/BJP Articulation:** Rooted in V.D. Savarkar’s *Hindutva: Who Is a Hindu?* (1923), which defines Hindu identity by **geography (pitribhumi), race (jati), and culture (sanskriti)**. The RSS’s *M.S. Golwalkar* in *Bunch of Thoughts* (1966) advocates **"Hindu Rashtra"** (Hindu nation) with **"cultural nationalism"** as its ethical core.

**Contrast with Other Frameworks:**
- **Gandhian Ethics:** *Sarvodaya* (welfare of all) and *ahimsa* (non-violence) vs. Hindutva’s majoritarianism.
- **Ambedkarite Ethics:** Annihilation of caste vs. Hindutva’s **"organic caste harmony"** model.
- **Secular Constitutional Ethics:** **"Equal respect for all religions"** (*sarva dharma sambhava*) vs. **"positive secularism"** (BJP’s formulation favoring majority cultural symbols).

**Ethical Flashpoints:**
- **2002 Gujarat Riots:** Supreme Court-monitored SIT found no conspiracy but documented **state complicity** in violence (per Amnesty International reports).
- **CAA-NRC Controversy (2019–2020):** The *Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019* offers citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from three countries, criticized as violating **Article 14** (equality before law). Protests invoked **"constitutional morality."**
- **Ram Mandir Dispute:** Supreme Court’s 2019 judgment (*M. Siddiq v. Mahant Suresh Das*) awarded the Ayodhya site for temple construction, citing **"faith and belief"** but ordering alternative land for a mosque—a **settlement ethics** over historical justice.

## 6. India in Global Ethics

**Non-Alignment as Ethical Position:** Jawaharlal Nehru’s 1954 *Panchsheel* (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) emphasized **sovereignty and non-interference**, later evolving into **"strategic autonomy."**

**Climate Negotiations:** India’s stance reflects **"common but differentiated responsibilities"** (CBDR) from the 1992 Rio Summit. At COP26 (2021), India committed to **net-zero by 2070** but emphasized **"climate justice"** for developing nations.

**"Pharmacy of the World" During COVID:** India supplied vaccines (COVAXIN, Covishield) to 100+ countries under **"Vaccine Maitri"** (Vaccine Friendship), embodying a **global care ethics** but facing domestic criticism for export during second wave (2021).

**AI Governance:** At the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), India advocates for **"ethical AI for development"** but resists binding regulations that might limit domestic industry.

## 7. Living Thinkers

**Amartya Sen (b. 1933):** In *The Idea of Justice* (2009), he contrasts **"transcendental institutionalism"** (Rawls) with **"realization-focused comparison"** rooted in Indian dialectical traditions (e.g., *Mahabharata*’s debate between Krishna and Arjuna). His **capability approach** (with Mahbub ul Haq) underpins India’s Human Development Index.

**Martha Nussbaum (b. 1947):** Trained in Indian philosophy, her *Women and Human Development* (2000) uses the **capabilities approach** to critique Indian gender inequality, drawing from **Jyotirao Phule** and **Rabindranath Tagore**.

**Ashis Nandy (b. 1937):** In *The Intimate Enemy* (1983), he critiques colonialism’s psychological violence and advocates recovering **"traditional pluralisms"** against homogenizing modernity.

**Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (b. 1942):** In *"Can the Subaltern Speak?"* (1988), she analyzes the **ethical silencing** of marginalized voices (e.g., *sati* discourse) and calls for **"ethical singularity"**—unmediated engagement with the other.

## 8. Key Scholars and Contested Historiography

**History Wars:**
- **Nationalist School:** R.C. Majumdar’s *History and Culture of the Indian People* (1951–1977) emphasizes Hindu civilizational continuity.
- **Marxist School:** D.D. Kosambi’s *An Introduction to the Study of Indian History* (1956) uses **dialectical materialism** to analyze caste and class.
- **Subaltern Studies Collective (1982–present):** Ranajit Guha, Dipesh Chakrabarty, et al. focus on **"history from below"** but criticized for neglecting caste (per Dalit critiques).
- **Hindutva Revisionism:** Dinanath Batra’s textbooks (adopted in Gujarat, 2014) promote **"indigenous science"** (e.g., ancient aviation in *Vaimanika Shastra*).

**Textbook Controversies:** The NCERT’s 2002 curriculum revision (under BJP) was accused of **"saffronization"**; the 2023 revision (under BJP) removes references to Mughals, Gujarat riots, and caste discrimination (per critics).

**Narrative Control:** The **Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR)** has shifted from Marxist to Hindutva-aligned leadership post-2014, influencing national ethical storytelling.

***

**Conclusion:** Contemporary Indian ethical thought is a **living dialectic** between constitutional universalism and particularist identities, between developmental aspiration and ecological limits, between technological promise and dignitarian peril. Its central tension remains: Can a civilization with **profound hierarchical inheritance** realize its constitutional pledge of **justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity**? The answer unfolds in daily ethical contests—from village *panchayats* to Supreme Court benches, from Dalit writings to AI labs—making India one of the world’s most vital ethical laboratories.

### Contemporary Indian Ethical Thought (1950-Present)

#### 1. The Indian Constitution as Ethical Document
The Indian Constitution, drafted under the leadership of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (1891–1956), is a foundational ethical document that seeks to legislate justice, equality, and fraternity. It reflects Ambedkar's vision of a society free from caste hierarchy and exploitation.

- **Fundamental Rights (Part III)** vs. **Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV)**: The tension between justiciable rights (e.g., Article 17 abolishing untouchability) and non-justiciable directives (e.g., Article 39 urging economic justice) reflects the ethical struggle between individual liberties and collective welfare.  
  - **Article 17**: Abolition of untouchability. This was a direct attack on caste hierarchy, criminalizing practices like manual scavenging (Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013).  
  - **Article 21**: Right to life and personal liberty, interpreted expansively in *Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India* (1978) to include dignity, environment, and livelihood.  
  - **Article 51A**: Fundamental duties added by the 42nd Amendment (1976), emphasizing environmental protection (Article 51A(g)) and scientific temper (Article 51A(h)).

The Constitution attempts to legislate ethics by balancing individual rights with social justice, yet tensions persist, such as in *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973), which upheld the "basic structure" doctrine, limiting Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights.

#### 2. The Ongoing Caste Struggle
Caste remains a central ethical challenge in contemporary India.

- **Reservations**: Affirmative action policies for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) were expanded after the Mandal Commission report (1990), leading to nationwide protests. The **Indra Sawhney v. Union of India** case (1992) upheld the 27% quota for OBCs but introduced a 50% cap.  
- **Rohith Vemula** (2016): A Dalit PhD student’s suicide highlighted caste discrimination in higher education, sparking nationwide protests and debates on institutionalized casteism.  
- **Dalit Literature**: Omprakash Valmiki’s *Joothan* (1997) and Bama’s *Karukku* (1992) provide testimonies of caste oppression, asserting Dalit agency and dignity.  
- **Caste Violence**: Persistent atrocities, such as the Khairlanji massacre (2006), underscore the failure of constitutional ethics to eradicate caste hierarchies.

#### 3. Environmental Ethics
India’s environmental ethics grapple with the tension between development and ecological stewardship.

- **Chipko Movement** (1973): A grassroots forest conservation movement in Uttarakhand, inspired by Gandhi’s principles of non-violence and sustainable living.  
- **Narmada Bachao Andolan**: Led by Medha Patkar, it challenged the Sardar Sarovar Dam project, highlighting displacement and ecological damage (Supreme Court judgment, 2000).  
- **Bhopal Disaster** (1984): The Union Carbide gas leak exposed corporate negligence and weak regulatory frameworks, raising ethical questions about industrial accountability.  
- **Vandana Shiva**: Advocate of seed sovereignty and bioethics, Shiva critiques corporate monopolies on agriculture (*The Violence of the Green Revolution*, 1991).

#### 4. Technology Ethics
India’s rapid technological advancements raise ethical dilemmas.

- **Aadhaar**: The world’s largest biometric ID system (1.3 billion enrollments) has faced scrutiny over privacy breaches (*Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India*, 2017).  
- **AI Ethics**: Companies like Sarvam and Krutrim are developing AI models, raising questions about cultural bias and ethical frameworks.  
- **IT Labor Ethics**: Exploitation in the IT sector, such as long working hours and lack of unionization, remains a concern.

#### 5. Hindu Nationalism (Hindutva) as Ethical Framework
Hindutva, promoted by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), offers a nationalist ethic rooted in Hindu cultural identity.

- **Ethical Vision**: Hindutva emphasizes "cultural nationalism" (*Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?* by V.D. Savarkar, 1923), contrasting with Gandhian pluralism and Ambedkarite social justice.  
- **Flashpoints**:  
  - **2002 Gujarat Riots**: State complicity in anti-Muslim violence (*R. Gandhi v. Union of India*, 2009).  
  - **CAA-NRC Controversy** (2019): Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) excluding Muslims from fast-track citizenship.  
  - **Ram Mandir Dispute**: The Supreme Court verdict (2019) awarding the Ayodhya site to Hindus, despite evidence of the Babri Masjid’s destruction (1992).

#### 6. India in Global Ethics
India’s global ethical stance is shaped by its history of non-alignment and developmental aspirations.

- **Non-Alignment**: Jawaharlal Nehru articulated non-alignment as an ethical alternative to Cold War geopolitics (Bandung Conference, 1955).  
- **Climate Negotiations**: India emphasizes "common but differentiated responsibilities" (CBDR), balancing development with climate action.  
- **COVID-19**: As the "pharmacy of the world," India supplied vaccines to over 95 countries through the COVAX initiative (2021).  
- **AI Governance**: India advocates for inclusive, equitable AI development (Global Partnership on AI, 2020).

#### 7. Living Thinkers
- **Amartya Sen**: Capability approach (*Development as Freedom*, 1999) and advocacy for justice (*The Idea of Justice*, 2009).  
- **Martha Nussbaum**: Collaborated with Sen on capabilities theory (*Women and Human Development*, 2000).  
- **Ashis Nandy**: Critiques modernity and colonialism (*The Intimate Enemy*, 1983).  
- **Gayatri Spivak**: Subaltern studies (*Can the Subaltern Speak?*, 1988).

#### 8. Key Scholars and Contested Historiography
The "history wars" in India revolve around the interpretation of caste, colonialism, and nationalism.

- **Textbook Controversies**: NCERT textbooks revised under BJP governments to emphasize Hindu nationalism (2001, 2017).  
- **Scholars**: Romila Thapar (*A History of India*, 1966) vs. Hindutva historians like Arun Shourie (*Eminent Historians*, 1998).  
- **Ethical Narratives**: Control over historical narratives reflects broader struggles over India’s ethical identity.

### Conclusion
Contemporary Indian ethics is marked by a dynamic interplay between constitutional ideals, caste struggles, environmentalism, technological advancement, and global engagement. The ethical landscape remains contested, reflecting both the enduring legacy of thinkers like Gandhi and Ambedkar and the challenges posed by new socio-political realities.

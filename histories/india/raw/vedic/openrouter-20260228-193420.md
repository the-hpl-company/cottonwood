### **Ethical Foundations in the Vedic Period (c. 1500–500 BCE)**  

The Vedic period laid the philosophical and ethical groundwork for later Indian thought, introducing key concepts such as **Rta (cosmic order)**, **dharma (moral duty)**, **ahimsa (non-harm)**, and the **Atman-Brahman identity**. These ideas evolved from external ritualism to internalized ethics, shaping India’s moral traditions.

### **1. Rta (Cosmic Order) in the Rig Veda**  
**Rta (ऋतम्)** refers to the cosmic and moral order governing the universe, upheld by gods like Varuna and Mitra. Ethical obligation arises from aligning human actions with this universal principle.  

- **Rig Veda 1.164.46**:  
  > *"Ekam sad viprā bahudhā vadanti"* ("The Truth is one, though the wise call it by many names").  
  This suggests an underlying unity in Rta, implying ethical consistency.  

- **Rig Veda 7.66.13**:  
  Varuna, guardian of Rta, punishes falsehood (*anṛta*), reinforcing truth as an ethical imperative.  

**Relation to Dharma**:  
Rta evolves into **dharma** (from *√dhr*, "to uphold") in later texts. While Rta is cosmic, dharma becomes its human application—moral duty contextualized by varna (caste) and ashrama (life-stage).

### **2. The Upanishads: Internalization of Ethics**  
The Upanishads shift focus from external rituals to **self-knowledge (Atman-Brahman identity)**, transforming ethics into an inward discipline.  

- **Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5**:  
  > *"Aham Brahmāsmi"* ("I am Brahman")—realizing this identity dissolves egoism, fostering universal compassion.  

- **Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7**:  
  > *"Tat tvam asi"* ("You are that")—the Self (Atman) is identical with Brahman, implying ethical treatment of others as extensions of oneself.  

**Ethical Implications**:  
If all beings partake in Brahman, harming another is self-harm—a philosophical root of **ahimsa**.

### **3. Early Dharma Literature: The Dharmasutras**  
The **Dharmasutras** (c. 600–300 BCE)—Gautama, Baudhayana, Apastamba, Vasishtha—codify **ritual and moral duties**, blending Vedic injunctions with social ethics.  

- **Gautama Dharmasutra 1.1-2**:  
  Lists **sources of dharma**: Veda, smriti (tradition), and conduct of the virtuous.  

- **Apastamba Dharmasutra 1.20.6**:  
  > "Truthfulness, non-injury, non-stealing, purity, and control of senses are common to all varnas."  

**Tension Between Ritual and Moral Duty**:  
While sacrifices (yajña) dominate early texts, the Dharmasutras increasingly emphasize **moral virtues** (satya, ahimsa) as equally binding.

### **4. Varnashrama Dharma: Caste and Life-Stage Ethics**  
The **varna system** (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and **ashrama system** (student, householder, forest-dweller, renunciant) structure ethical obligations.  

- **Rig Veda 10.90 (Purusha Sukta)**:  
  Mythologizes varna divisions but is likely a later interpolation (Wendy Doniger, *The Rig Veda*, 1981).  

- **Manusmriti 1.87-91**:  
  Assigns duties hierarchically—Brahmins (study), Kshatriyas (protect), Vaishyas (trade), Shudras (serve).  

**Ethical Logic vs. Oppression**:  
- **Internal Logic**: Each varna contributes to social harmony (like bodily organs).  
- **Oppressive Outcomes**: Shudras and "untouchables" (Dalits) face systemic exclusion, justified as karmic destiny.  

Patrick Olivelle (*Dharmasutras*, 1999) notes that while **varna was idealized**, historical practice was more fluid.  

---

### **5. Ahimsa: Early Forms and Development**  
**Ahimsa (non-harm)** appears first in **late Vedic texts**, gaining prominence in the Upanishads.  

- **Chandogya Upanishad 3.17.4**:  
  Lists ahimsa among virtues for Brahmins.  

- **Taittiriya Upanishad 1.11**:  
  > *"Do not harm any being"*—linking non-violence to spiritual purity.  

**Vedic to Upanishadic Shift**:  
- **Early Vedic**: Sacrificial violence (animal offerings) is permitted.  
- **Later Thought**: Ahimsa becomes a moral ideal, culminating in Jainism/Buddhism.  

Sheldon Pollock (*The Language of the Gods*, 2006) argues that **ahimsa’s rise correlates with urbanization**, as ritual violence became socially problematic.

### **6. Key Scholars and Contested Interpretations**  
- **Patrick Olivelle**: Argues Dharmasutras reflect **Brahmanical consolidation** post-Vedic period.  
- **Wendy Doniger**: Highlights **mythological interpolations** (e.g., Purusha Sukta) to justify caste.  
- **Sheldon Pollock**: Examines how **political power shaped dharma** (e.g., Kshatriya-Brahmin alliance).  

**Aryan Migration Debate**:  
- **Traditional View**: Vedic ethics emerged from Indo-Aryan culture.  
- **Alternative Views**: Indigenous Harappan influences (David Frawley) vs. migration-based models (Michael Witzel).  
This impacts whether **ahimsa and egalitarian ethics** are seen as indigenous or later developments.

### **Conclusion**  
The Vedic period’s ethics evolved from **cosmic order (Rta)** to **internalized morality (Atman-Brahman)**, codified in **dharma literature** but entangled with **caste hierarchy**. While **ahimsa** and **universal compassion** emerged philosophically, **social exclusion** remained entrenched—a tension unresolved in later traditions.

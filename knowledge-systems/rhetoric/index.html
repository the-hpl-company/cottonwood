<hr />
<h2 id="greek-tradition">Greek Tradition</h2>
<h3 id="the-sophists-and-the-birth-of-techne">The Sophists and the Birth of Techne</h3>
<p>The formal study of rhetoric (<em>rhetorike techne</em>) emerges in 5th-century BCE Athens as a teachable skill. Protagoras (c. 490–420 BCE), in his <em>Antilogies</em>, argues that &ldquo;on every issue there are two arguments opposed to each other,&rdquo; establishing rhetoric as the art of constructing persuasive cases. Gorgias of Leontini (c. 483–375 BCE), in his <em>Encomium of Helen</em>, demonstrates rhetoric&rsquo;s power to absolve and persuade through the &ldquo;force of speech&rdquo; (<em>logos</em>), which he compares to a drug affecting the soul. Modern scholars, notably Edward Schiappa (<em>The Beginnings of Rhetorical Theory in Classical Greece</em>, 1999), have argued for the rehabilitation of the Sophists as serious thinkers about the relationship between language and knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="platonic-hostility-rhetoric-as-flattery">Platonic Hostility: Rhetoric as Flattery</h3>
<p>Plato (c. 428–348 BCE) mounts a philosophical attack in two dialogues. In <em>Gorgias</em> (c. 380 BCE), Socrates distinguishes true arts (<em>technai</em>) like medicine from mere flattery (<em>kolakeia</em>), placing rhetoric alongside cookery as a knack for pleasing without knowledge of the good. In <em>Phaedrus</em> (c. 370 BCE), Plato concedes a possible &ldquo;true rhetoric&rdquo; grounded in dialectical knowledge of truth and the soul&rsquo;s nature, but condemns contemporary practice as manipulative.</p>
<h3 id="aristotelian-systematization-rhetoric-as-counterpart">Aristotelian Systematization: Rhetoric as Counterpart</h3>
<p>Aristotle (384–322 BCE) rehabilitates rhetoric in his <em>Rhetoric</em> (c. 350 BCE) as the &ldquo;faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion.&rdquo; He systematizes three artistic proofs: <em>logos</em> (argument), <em>ethos</em> (character of the speaker), and <em>pathos</em> (emotional disposition of the audience). For Aristotle, rhetoric is the counterpart (<em>antistrophos</em>) to dialectic, necessary for civic deliberation about probable matters where certainty is impossible.</p>
<h3 id="isocrates-rhetoric-as-civic-paideia">Isocrates: Rhetoric as Civic Paideia</h3>
<p>Isocrates (436–338 BCE), in <em>Antidosis</em> (c. 353 BCE) and <em>Against the Sophists</em>, argues that rhetoric (<em>philosophia</em>) is the foundation of civic education, cultivating practical wisdom (<em>phronesis</em>) and moral character for leadership. His school trained generations of Athenian statesmen, positioning eloquence as essential to just governance.</p>
<p>The Greek tradition fractures on the relationship between persuasion and truth. For Plato, rhetoric divorced from philosophical truth is unjust power. For Aristotle, rhetoric discovers probable truths in the political realm. For Isocrates, rhetoric cultivates the virtuous power necessary for just leadership.</p>
<h2 id="roman-tradition">Roman Tradition</h2>
<h3 id="ciceronian-synthesis-the-orator-as-ideal-citizen">Ciceronian Synthesis: The Orator as Ideal Citizen</h3>
<p>Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BCE), in <em>De Oratore</em> (55 BCE), defines the perfect orator (<em>perfectus orator</em>) as one who can speak &ldquo;on all subjects with fullness and variety.&rdquo; He formalizes the five canons of rhetoric: <em>inventio</em> (discovery of arguments), <em>dispositio</em> (arrangement), <em>elocutio</em> (style), <em>memoria</em> (memory), and <em>actio</em> (delivery). In <em>Brutus</em> and <em>Orator</em>, Cicero argues that true eloquence requires comprehensive knowledge of philosophy, law, and history, making rhetoric the supreme civil art.</p>
<h3 id="quintilian-rhetoric-as-moral-education">Quintilian: Rhetoric as Moral Education</h3>
<p>Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (c. 35–100 CE), in his <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> (c. 95 CE), defines the orator as &ldquo;a good man speaking well&rdquo; (<em>vir bonus dicendi peritus</em> — a formulation he attributes to Cato the Elder). His twelve-book treatise systematizes rhetorical education from childhood through professional practice, emphasizing moral character as the foundation of persuasive power.</p>
<p>Roman rhetoric explicitly links persuasion with civic power and justice. The orator&rsquo;s duty is to guide the state through wise counsel. Eloquence without moral character is dangerous; true eloquence serves justice.</p>
<h2 id="chinese-tradition">Chinese Tradition</h2>
<h3 id="bian-argumentation-in-the-warring-states">Bian: Argumentation in the Warring States</h3>
<p>During the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), <em>bian</em> (argumentation, discrimination) becomes essential for persuading rulers. Masters of competing schools travel between states offering counsel. The <em>Guiguzi</em>, attributed to the hermit Wang Xu (c. 4th–3rd century BCE), systematizes persuasion techniques for political advisors, emphasizing psychological adaptation to the ruler&rsquo;s mind. Figures like Su Qin exemplified the Warring States persuader — traveling between courts, deploying rhetoric as statecraft.</p>
<h3 id="confucian-suspicion-of-clever-speech">Confucian Suspicion of Clever Speech</h3>
<p>Confucius (551–479 BCE) in the <em>Analects</em> warns: &ldquo;Clever words and a pleasing countenance seldom speak of humanity&rdquo; (1:3). He advocates <em>zhengming</em> (rectification of names) — ensuring words correspond to reality and proper social roles — over mere persuasiveness. True influence comes from moral virtue (<em>de</em>) rather than rhetorical skill.</p>
<h3 id="mencius-as-rhetorical-practitioner">Mencius as Rhetorical Practitioner</h3>
<p>Mencius (372–289 BCE), while sharing Confucian ideals, masterfully employs analogies, stories, and logical traps in the <em>Mencius</em> to convert rulers to humane governance. His debate with King Hui of Liang (<em>Mencius</em> 1A1) demonstrates <em>bian</em> in service of Confucian principles — persuasion as moral obligation.</p>
<h3 id="legalist-embrace-of-strategic-communication">Legalist Embrace of Strategic Communication</h3>
<p>The Legalist text <em>Han Feizi</em> (c. 3rd century BCE) addresses the difficulty and danger of persuading rulers in its chapter &ldquo;The Difficulties of Persuasion&rdquo; (<em>Shuinan</em>). Han Fei analyzes why competent advisors fail — not for lack of knowledge, but because they misjudge the ruler&rsquo;s desires and fears. This treats rhetoric as a survival skill in autocratic governance, not a tool of population control.</p>
<p>In Chinese traditions, persuasion is evaluated by its alignment with the <em>Dao</em> (Way) and social harmony. Confucians subordinate rhetoric to moral truth; Legalists treat it as statecraft. Eloquence serves justice when it promotes humane governance (<em>renzheng</em>).</p>
<h2 id="arabicislamic-tradition">Arabic/Islamic Tradition</h2>
<h3 id="balagha-the-science-of-eloquence">Balagha: The Science of Eloquence</h3>
<p><em>Balagha</em> (the science of eloquence) develops as a systematic discipline analyzing the Quran&rsquo;s inimitability. Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani (d. 1078 CE), in <em>Dala&rsquo;il al-I&rsquo;jaz</em> (<em>Proofs of Inimitability</em>), establishes the theory of <em>nazm</em> (word order and syntactic relationships) as the source of rhetorical effect, moving beyond mere figures of speech to deep linguistic structure.</p>
<h3 id="ijaz-the-inimitability-of-the-quran">I&rsquo;jaz: The Inimitability of the Quran</h3>
<p>The doctrine of <em>i&rsquo;jaz al-Quran</em> (the Quran&rsquo;s inimitability) serves as both theological proof and rhetorical theory. The Quran&rsquo;s challenge to produce a single chapter like it (Surah 2:23) positions it as the ultimate rhetorical achievement, beyond human replication. This drives analytical work identifying the sources of its persuasive power.</p>
<h3 id="khatib-the-oratorical-tradition">Khatib: The Oratorical Tradition</h3>
<p>The <em>khatib</em> delivers the Friday sermon (<em>khutbah</em>), a continuous oratorical practice since the Prophet Muhammad. Manuals like Ibn Nubata&rsquo;s (d. 984 CE) <em>Kitab al-Khutab</em> and Ibn al-Athir&rsquo;s <em>al-Mathal al-Sa&rsquo;ir</em> (13th c.) codify sermon rhetoric, blending religious exhortation with political commentary. The <em>khatib</em> combines spiritual authority with civic leadership.</p>
<p>In Islamic tradition, ultimate rhetorical truth resides in the divine speech of the Quran. Human eloquence (<em>balagha</em>) seeks to understand and approximate this perfection. Rhetorical power must serve religious truth and social justice (<em>adl</em>).</p>
<h2 id="sanskrit-tradition">Sanskrit Tradition</h2>
<h3 id="vakya-sentence-and-discourse-theory">Vakya: Sentence and Discourse Theory</h3>
<p>The Sanskrit linguistic-philosophical tradition analyzes <em>vakya</em> (sentence/discourse) as the unit of meaningful communication. Bhartrihari&rsquo;s <em>Vakyapadiya</em> (5th century CE) develops <em>sphota</em> theory — the idea that meaning emerges holistically from the sentence rather than compositionally from words — which influences rhetorical understanding of how discourse persuades as a unified whole.</p>
<h3 id="rasa-aesthetic-persuasion">Rasa: Aesthetic Persuasion</h3>
<p>The <em>kavya</em> (poetic) tradition, exemplified in works like Dandin&rsquo;s <em>Kavyadarsha</em> (7th century CE) and Anandavardhana&rsquo;s <em>Dhvanyaloka</em> (9th century CE), analyzes how poetry evokes <em>rasa</em> (aesthetic emotion). Persuasion operates through <em>dhvani</em> (suggestion) rather than direct statement, affecting the audience&rsquo;s emotional state.</p>
<h3 id="natyashastra-on-dramatic-persuasion">Natyashastra on Dramatic Persuasion</h3>
<p>Bharata Muni&rsquo;s <em>Natyashastra</em> (c. 200 BCE–200 CE), while primarily a dramaturgical text, systematically analyzes emotional states (<em>bhavas</em>) and their expression through verbal and non-verbal means. Its theory of how performance creates shared emotional experience (<em>rasa</em>) informs understanding of rhetorical effect. The <em>Nyaya Sutras</em> further formalize debate into three modes: <em>vada</em> (honest debate seeking truth), <em>jalpa</em> (debate to win), and <em>vitanda</em> (destructive debate) — a taxonomy of rhetorical intent absent from the Greek tradition.</p>
<p>Sanskrit rhetoric often separates aesthetic persuasion (<em>kavya</em>) from philosophical truth (<em>pramana</em>). Eloquence (<em>vakrokti</em>, indirect expression) is valued for its aesthetic power, which can serve ethical ends when aligned with <em>dharma</em>.</p>
<h2 id="west-african-tradition">West African Tradition</h2>
<h3 id="palaver-as-deliberative-institution">Palaver as Deliberative Institution</h3>
<p>Across West African societies like the Akan, Yoruba, and Mande, <em>palaver</em> refers to extended communal discourse aimed at consensus. Among the Akan, the <em>mpanyimfo</em> (elders) conduct <em>nkomwa</em> (deliberations) following protocols that ensure all voices are heard before decision-making. Akan <em>kasakoa</em> (proverbial diplomacy) uses indirect, metaphorical speech to address sensitive political matters without direct confrontation. Rhetoric here is institutionalized as social process.</p>
<h3 id="griot-as-rhetorical-memory">Griot as Rhetorical Memory</h3>
<p>The <em>griot</em> (French term; <em>jeli</em> in Manding, <em>gawlo</em> in Fulani) serves as oral historian, genealogist, advisor, and praise-singer. Through mastery of formulaic language, proverbs, and historical narrative, the griot persuades by connecting present action to ancestral precedent. The Mande epic <em>Sundiata</em> (13th century) exemplifies griot rhetoric preserving and shaping communal identity. Babayemi&rsquo;s <em>Oral Tradition in Yoruba Historiography</em> (1980) documents how these rhetorical forms constitute a rigorous system of historical knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="oratory-and-governance">Oratory and Governance</h3>
<p>Yoruba <em>oriki</em> (praise poetry) and Akan <em>apae</em> (military poetry) demonstrate rhetoric&rsquo;s political functions. The <em>Okyeame</em> (linguist) in Akan courts artfully mediates between ruler and people, translating and refining speech. Eloquence here maintains social balance and legitimizes authority through skillful verbal performance.</p>
<p>West African traditions treat rhetoric as constitutive of social reality and power. Truth emerges through communal discourse (<em>palaver</em>); eloquence demonstrates wisdom and legitimizes authority. Justice requires inclusive deliberation where skilled speech guides consensus.</p>
<h2 id="modern-developments">Modern Developments</h2>
<h3 id="kenneth-burke-rhetoric-as-identification">Kenneth Burke: Rhetoric as Identification</h3>
<p>Kenneth Burke, in <em>A Rhetoric of Motives</em> (1950), redefines rhetoric as &ldquo;the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.&rdquo; His concept of <em>identification</em> (consubstantiality) replaces persuasion as the central mechanism, analyzing how discourse creates shared identity.</p>
<h3 id="perelman-and-olbrechts-tyteca-the-new-rhetoric">Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca: The New Rhetoric</h3>
<p>Chaim Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca&rsquo;s <em>Traite de l&rsquo;argumentation: La nouvelle rhetorique</em> (1958) revives rhetorical study of argumentation, shifting from demonstrative proof to persuasive argument aimed at securing adherence of minds. Their theory of the <em>universal audience</em> tests argument validity.</p>
<h3 id="postcolonial-rhetoric-whose-persuasion-counts">Postcolonial Rhetoric: Whose Persuasion Counts?</h3>
<p>Postcolonial theorists question the universality of Western rhetorical norms. Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s <em>Decolonising the Mind</em> (1986) examines how language itself carries persuasive power structures. Gloria Anzaldua&rsquo;s <em>Borderlands/La Frontera</em> (1987) practices code-switching as rhetorical resistance. Gayatri Spivak&rsquo;s work on subaltern speech acts asks whether the marginalized can be heard within dominant rhetorical frameworks. These works ask whose modes of persuasion are recognized as legitimate.</p>
<p>Modern rhetoric becomes increasingly self-reflexive about its relationship to power. Burke sees rhetoric as fundamental to human sociality; Perelman seeks rational standards for argument; postcolonial rhetoric exposes how persuasive norms themselves can be instruments of domination.</p>
<h2 id="known-gaps-and-limitations">Known Gaps and Limitations</h2>
<p>This page is incomplete. The following are known gaps we have not yet addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The <em>Guiguzi</em> misidentification</strong> — An earlier version of this page conflated the <em>Guiguzi</em> with the <em>Zhanguo Ce</em> (<em>Strategems of the Warring States</em>). These are distinct texts. The <em>Guiguzi</em> is a treatise on persuasion strategy; the <em>Zhanguo Ce</em> is a historical compilation. This has been corrected but the correction should be verified by specialists.</li>
<li><strong>Japanese rhetorical traditions</strong> — The <em>kotodama</em> (word-spirit) tradition and its relationship to political speech is absent.</li>
<li><strong>Southeast Asian traditions</strong> — Javanese <em>halus</em> (refined) speech registers and Thai <em>kreng jai</em> (consideration-based communication) represent sophisticated rhetorical systems not addressed here.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenous American traditions</strong> — Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) oratorical traditions, including the Great Law of Peace, are unrepresented.</li>
<li><strong>Digital rhetoric</strong> — The transformation of persuasion in computational environments (algorithmic curation, generative text) is not addressed.</li>
<li><strong>The <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em></strong> — This influential Roman text (c. 90 BCE), previously attributed to Cicero, is absent from the Roman section.</li>
<li><strong>West African coverage</strong> — The section is illustrative rather than comprehensive. The Oyo Empire&rsquo;s institutional rhetoric, and the role of the <em>Oro</em> cult in governance, deserve treatment.</li>

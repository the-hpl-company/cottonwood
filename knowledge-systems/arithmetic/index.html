<h1 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h1>
<p><em>First art of the quadrivium. Part of <a href="https://cottonwood.world">The Cottonwood Collection</a> — a public reference library on harm, care, and stewardship.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="babylonian-tradition-c-2000500-bce">Babylonian Tradition (c. 2000–500 BCE)</h2>
<p>The Babylonian arithmetic system was sexagesimal (base-60), a choice that facilitated division and astronomical calculation. This system was recorded on clay tablets using a cuneiform place-value notation, though the absence of a final zero symbol could create ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Administration and Commerce:</strong> Arithmetic was foundational to the bureaucratic state. Tablets from sites like Nippur and Ur document the calculation of rations, land areas (using geometric formulas), and interest on loans. The <em>Code of Hammurabi</em> (c. 1750 BCE) prescribes fixed rates for commodities, making standardized calculation a legal necessity.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract Relationships:</strong> The <em>Plimpton 322</em> tablet (c. 1800 BCE) lists Pythagorean triples (integer solutions to a² + b² = c²), demonstrating an abstract, algorithmic investigation of number theory independent of immediate geometric application. The <em>YBC 7289</em> tablet demonstrates a calculation of √2 accurate to six decimal places.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical Astronomy:</strong> The sexagesimal system reached its zenith in Babylonian mathematical astronomy (c. 500 BCE onward). Tablets like <em>MUL.APIN</em> and ephemerides used arithmetic sequences (zigzag functions) to predict lunar and planetary phenomena with remarkable accuracy, divorcing calculation from physical cosmology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arithmetic in Babylon was a tool of imperial administration, commercial law, and celestial prediction, with its base-60 system revealing a preference for highly divisible units suited to both grain and time.</p>
<h2 id="egyptian-tradition-c-20001500-bce">Egyptian Tradition (c. 2000–1500 BCE)</h2>
<p>Egyptian arithmetic, documented primarily in administrative and instructional texts, employed a decimal system with distinct hieroglyphs for powers of ten. Its most distinctive feature was the use of unit fractions (with a numerator of 1), with the notable exception of 2/3.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Rhind and Moscow Papyri:</strong> The <em>Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</em> (c. 1550 BCE) and the <em>Moscow Mathematical Papyrus</em> (c. 1850 BCE) are compendia of practical problems. They present arithmetic techniques — doubling, halving, addition — applied to the distribution of bread and beer, the calculation of grain storage volumes, and land area.</li>
<li><strong>Arithmetic for Architecture and Surveying:</strong> After the annual Nile flood obliterated field boundaries, geometry and arithmetic (<em>seked</em>, the equivalent of a cotangent) were used to restore them. The construction of pyramids required constant calculation of slopes, volumes, and labor quotas, making arithmetic a priestly and scribal skill central to maintaining cosmic and social order (<em>ma&rsquo;at</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Egyptian arithmetic was relentlessly practical, focused on the concrete problems of redistribution, construction, and land management. Its fraction system optimized for halving and summing, reflecting a material culture of equitable division.</p>
<h2 id="indian-tradition-c-800-bce-1600-ce">Indian Tradition (c. 800 BCE – 1600 CE)</h2>
<p>Indian arithmetic developed within the context of Vedic ritual, astronomical calculation, and philosophical inquiry into the nature of the void (<em>shunya</em>). It achieved a fully realized place-value decimal system with zero as a number.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Sulbasutras (c. 800–500 BCE):</strong> These ritual manuals for altar construction, attributed to authors including Baudhayana, contain geometric-arithmetic rules for transforming squares into rectangles and circles, implicitly using Pythagorean principles and square root approximations.</li>
<li><strong>The Classical Synthesis:</strong> <em>Aryabhatiya</em> of Aryabhata (499 CE) explicitly describes a place-value system using consonants for digits and vowels for place. He treats zero as a placeholder. <em>Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta</em> of Brahmagupta (628 CE) provides the first definitive arithmetic rules for zero and negative numbers, stating that a debt subtracted from zero becomes a fortune.</li>
<li><strong>The Kerala School (c. 1350–1600 CE):</strong> Mathematicians like Madhava of Sangamagrama and Nilakantha (1444–1544) developed infinite series expansions for pi and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine). These results, recorded in texts like the <em>Yuktibhasha</em> (c. 1530 CE), were arithmetical tours de force for astronomical computation, predating similar discoveries in Europe by approximately three centuries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indian arithmetic treated number as an abstract entity for philosophical and cosmological exploration. The development of zero and negative numbers emerged from a conceptual space where debt, absence, and the void were legitimate subjects of calculation.</p>
<h2 id="chinese-tradition-c-300-bce-1400-ce">Chinese Tradition (c. 300 BCE – 1400 CE)</h2>
<p>Chinese arithmetic was algorithmic and problem-oriented, using a decimal place-value system with rod numerals — a physical, positional notation where numbers were represented by arrangements of counting rods on a board.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Jiuzhang Suanshu (Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE):</strong> This foundational text organizes 246 problems by type: field measurement, exchange rates, distribution, engineering works, taxation. Its solutions present general algorithms (<em>shu</em>) for solving systems of linear equations (using matrix-like methods) and calculating areas and volumes.</li>
<li><strong>The Sunzi Suanjing (c. 400 CE):</strong> Contains the earliest known statement of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a method for solving systems of congruences — a problem arising from calendrical calculation and military logistics.</li>
<li><strong>The Abacus Tradition:</strong> By the Ming Dynasty (14th century CE), the suanpan (abacus) had become the dominant tool for commercial and administrative calculation. Cheng Dawei&rsquo;s <em>Suanfa Tongzong</em> (1592) codified abacus methods, embodying the physical, tactile approach to arithmetic that characterized the tradition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chinese arithmetic was a technocratic art for statecraft. Its rod-based system facilitated algorithmic thinking focused on solving standardized problems of land, grain, and labor for a centralized bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="mayan-tradition-c-300900-ce">Mayan Tradition (c. 300–900 CE)</h2>
<p>Mayan arithmetic was vigesimal (base-20) and intimately tied to a complex calendrical and astronomical system. It featured an independent discovery of zero as a placeholder, represented by a shell glyph.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Long Count Calendar:</strong> This linear count of days required sophisticated arithmetic. Dates were expressed in nested place values (kins, uinals, tuns, etc.), making multiplication and addition essential for calculating intervals between celestial events and historical records.</li>
<li><strong>Astronomical Calculation:</strong> Mayan astronomers used their arithmetic system to compute the synodic periods of Venus and the lunar cycle with high precision, recording these calculations in codices like the <em>Dresden Codex</em>. Arithmetic was the engine of a cosmology where time was divine and cyclical.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mayan arithmetic was a sacerdotal science. Its base-20 system likely originated from a count of fingers and toes, but was elevated into a tool for modeling sacred time, binding number directly to cosmology and kingship.</p>
<h2 id="islamic-golden-age-c-8001300-ce">Islamic Golden Age (c. 800–1300 CE)</h2>
<p>Scholars in the Abbasid Caliphate synthesized Greek, Indian, and Persian knowledge, transforming arithmetic into a systematic discipline with new abstractions. They served as the crucial conduit for the Indian decimal place-value system (with zero) to the West.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithm and Algebra:</strong> Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi&rsquo;s <em>Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala</em> (c. 830 CE) systematized methods for solving linear and quadratic equations, giving the field its name. His name, via Latin translation, gave us the word &ldquo;algorithm.&rdquo; His later work, <em>On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals</em>, championed the decimal system.</li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Advancements:</strong> Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), in his <em>Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra</em>, geometrically classified and solved cubic equations. Al-Uqlidisi (952 CE) produced the earliest known treatment of decimal fractions. Al-Kashi (1427) computed pi to sixteen decimal places — a record that would stand for nearly two centuries.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial and Scientific Application:</strong> The new arithmetic was disseminated through manuals for merchants (<em>hisab</em>) and astronomers (<em>zij</em>), unifying trade, inheritance law, and celestial computation under a single numerical framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Islamic arithmetic was encyclopedic and synthesizing. It transformed calculation from a collection of techniques into a demonstrative science, consciously building a universal language of quantity for an empire of trade and faith.</p>
<h2 id="west-african-and-andean-traditions">West African and Andean Traditions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yoruba Numeration (Nigeria):</strong> The Yoruba language employs a vigesimal (base-20) system with sophisticated subtractive principles. Numbers like 45 are constructed as <em>meeedogun</em> — &ldquo;five from twenty three times&rdquo; (3 x 20 - 15). This system reveals a conceptual arithmetic of grouping and ungrouping, optimized for mental calculation and market exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Inca Quipu (Andes, c. 1400–1532 CE):</strong> The quipu was a recording device of knotted cords. It used a decimal positional system, where knot type and position on a string denoted units, tens, hundreds, etc. Quipus recorded census data, tribute quotas, and calendrical information. Martin de Murua&rsquo;s <em>Historia General del Peru</em> (1590) documents their administrative use, making arithmetic a tactile technology for governing a vast empire without a script.</li>
</ul>
<p>These systems demonstrate that advanced abstract arithmetic — place-value, zero as placeholder — can exist entirely outside a written numeral tradition, embedded instead in language or physical artifacts of state control.</p>
<h2 id="european-transmission-and-commercial-revolution-c-12001600-ce">European Transmission and Commercial Revolution (c. 1200–1600 CE)</h2>
<p>The adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in Europe, a centuries-long process, fundamentally reshaped Western arithmetic from a scholarly to a mercantile tool.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fibonacci&rsquo;s <em>Liber Abaci</em> (1202):</strong> Leonardo Fibonacci&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Calculation&rdquo; introduced the Hindu-Arabic numerals and algorithms to Italy through practical problems of trade, currency exchange, and profit calculation. It demonstrated the system&rsquo;s superiority over Roman numerals for complex computation.</li>
<li><strong>The Treviso Arithmetic (1478):</strong> One of the first printed mathematics books, this Italian manual taught the &ldquo;rule of three&rdquo; (proportion) and other commercial algorithms. It marks the full democratization of arithmetic as the essential skill for merchants, bankers, and artisans.</li>
<li><strong>Double-Entry Bookkeeping:</strong> Pioneered in Italian city-states, this system (first fully described by Luca Pacioli in 1494) applied arithmetic to create a complete, closed model of a firm&rsquo;s financial state, enabling new scales of commercial enterprise and capital management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European trajectory transformed arithmetic from an imported curiosity into the foundational logic of capitalism. Abstraction became a tool not for state administration or cosmology, but for private profit and credit, embedding calculation at the heart of everyday economic life.</p>
<h2 id="known-gaps-and-limitations">Known Gaps and Limitations</h2>
<p>This page is incomplete. The following are known gaps we have not yet addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethiopian arithmetic</strong> — The Ge&rsquo;ez numeral system and its relationship to Coptic and Greek traditions is absent.</li>
<li><strong>Persian contributions</strong> — Islamic-era arithmetic is presented as a unified tradition, but Persian contributions (particularly from the Samarkand school) deserve separate treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Combinatorics</strong> — Indian contributions to combinatorics (Mahavira, Bhaskara II) and their relationship to arithmetic are not addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Statistical reasoning</strong> — The development of probabilistic and statistical arithmetic across civilizations is entirely absent.</li>
<li><strong>Brahmagupta&rsquo;s division by zero</strong> — Brahmagupta stated that 0/0 = 0, a claim that is mathematically undefined by modern standards. This historical claim is not addressed in the text and deserves discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Mayan architectural arithmetic</strong> — The relationship between base-20 arithmetic and architectural dimensions (e.g., at Tikal, Chichen Itza) is not explored.</li>
<li><strong>Oral arithmetic traditions</strong> — Mental calculation traditions (e.g., Vedic mathematics, market arithmetic in West Africa) are underrepresented.</li>
